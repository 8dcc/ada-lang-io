<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0119-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0330-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The execution of an Ada program consists of the execution of one or more <em>tasks</em>. Each task represents a separable activity that proceeds independently and concurrently between the points where it <em>interacts</em> with other tasks. A single task, when within the context of a parallel construct, can represent multiple <em>logical threads of control</em> which can proceed in parallel; in other contexts, each task represents one logical thread of control. <br /></p>

<strong>To be honest: </strong>The execution of an Ada program consists of the execution of one or more partitions (see <a href="../AA-10/AA-10.2">10.2</a>), each of which in turn consists of the execution of an environment task and zero or more subtasks. <br /></Admonition>

<p>In addition, tasks can communicate indirectly by reading and updating (unprotected) shared variables, presuming the access is properly synchronized through some other kind of task interaction.<br /></p>


#### Static Semantics

</MarginText>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<p>The properties of a task are defined by a corresponding task declaration and <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.1#S0248">task_body</a></code>, which together define a program unit called a <em>task unit</em>. <br /></p>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>

</AnnotatedOnly>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0119-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Over time, tasks proceed through various <em>states</em>. A task is initially <em>inactive</em>; upon activation, and prior to its <em>termination</em> it is either <em>blocked</em> (as part of some task interaction) or <em>ready</em> to run. While ready, a task competes for the available <em>execution resources</em> that it requires to run. In the context of a parallel construct, a single task can utilize multiple processing resources simultaneously. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The means for selecting which of the ready tasks to run, given the currently available execution resources, is determined by the <em>task dispatching policy</em> in effect, which is generally implementation defined, but may be controlled by aspects, pragmas, and operations defined in the Real-Time Annex (see <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.2">D.2</a> and <a href="../AA-D/AA-D.5">D.5</a>). <br /></Admonition>

NOTE 1   {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0119-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0440-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Concurrent task execution can be implemented on multicomputers, multiprocessors, or with interleaved execution on a single physical processor. On the other hand, whenever an implementation can determine that the required semantic effects can be achieved when parts of the execution of a single logical thread of control are performed by different physical processors acting in parallel, it can choose to perform them in this way.<br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
We use the term "concurrent" rather than "parallel" when talking about logically independent execution of threads of control. The term "parallel" is reserved for referring to the situation where multiple physical processors run simultaneously. <br /></Admonition>
