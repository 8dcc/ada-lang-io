# 6.6 Overloading of Operators

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.

<p>An <em>operator</em> is a function whose <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0199">designator</a></code> is an <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0202">operator_symbol</a></code>. [Operators, like other functions, may be overloaded.] </p>

#### Name Resolution Rules

<p>Each use of a unary or binary operator is equivalent to a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code> with <em>function_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> being the corresponding <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0202">operator_symbol</a></code>, and with (respectively) one or two positional actual parameters being the operand(s) of the operator (in order). </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} We also use the term operator (in Clause 4 and in 6.1) to refer to one of the syntactic categories defined in 4.5, "Operators and Expression Evaluation" whose names end with "_operator:" <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#S0142">logical_operator</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#S0143">relational_operator</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#S0144">binary_adding_operator</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#S0145">unary_adding_operator</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#S0146">multiplying_operator</a></code>, and <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.5#S0147">highest_precedence_operator</a></code>. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} This equivalence extends to uses of <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code> in most other language rules. However, as often happens, the equivalence is not perfect, as operator calls are not a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>, while a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code> is a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>. Thus, operator calls cannot be used in contexts that require a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> (such as a rename of an object). A direct fix for this problem would be very disruptive, and thus we have not done that. However, qualifying an operator call can be used as a workaround in contexts that require a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>. </p></Admonition>


#### Legality Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0143-1"}</em>{"}"} The <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0196">subprogram_specification</a></code> of a unary or binary operator shall have one or two parameters, respectively. The parameters shall be of mode <strong>in</strong>. A generic function instantiation whose <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0199">designator</a></code> is an <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0202">operator_symbol</a></code> is only allowed if the specification of the generic function has the corresponding number of parameters, and they are all of mode <strong>in</strong>.</p>
<p><code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">Default_expression</a></code>s are not allowed for the parameters of an operator (whether the operator is declared with an explicit <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0196">subprogram_specification</a></code> or by a <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0315">generic_instantiation</a></code>).</p>
<p>An explicit declaration of "/=" shall not have a result type of the predefined type Boolean. </p>

#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0128-1"}</em>{"}"} An explicit declaration of "=" whose result type is Boolean implicitly declares an operator "/=" that gives the complementary result. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0128-1"}</em>{"}"} A "/=" defined by this rule is considered user-defined, which means that it will be inherited by a derived type. "User-defined" means "not language-defined" for the purposes of inheritance, that is anything other than predefined operators. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>NOTE 1   {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0440-1"}</em>{"}"} The operators "+" and "" are both unary and binary operators, and hence can be overloaded with both one- and two-parameter functions. </p></Admonition>


#### Examples

<p><em>Examples of user-defined operators:</em> </p>
<CodeBlock>
function "+" (Left, Right : Matrix) return Matrix;{"\n"}function "+" (Left, Right : Vector) return Vector;{"\n"}{"\n"}--  assuming that A, B, and C are of the type Vector{"\n"}--  the following two statements are equivalent:{"\n"}{"\n"}A := B + C;{"\n"}A := "+"(B, C);{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>


#### Extensions to Ada 83

<Admonition type="note">
<p>Explicit declarations of "=" are now permitted for any combination of parameter and result types.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>Explicit declarations of "/=" are now permitted, so long as the result type is not Boolean. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2005

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0128-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Corrected the wording so that only explicit declarations of "=" cause an implicit declaration of "/="; otherwise, we could get multiple implicit definitions of "/=" without an obvious way to chose between them.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0143-1"}</em>{"}"} Added wording so that operators only allow parameters of mode <strong>in</strong>. This was made necessary by the elimination elsewhere of the restriction that function parameters be only of mode <strong>in</strong>. </p></Admonition>
