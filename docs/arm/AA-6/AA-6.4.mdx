# 6.4 Subprogram Calls

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.

<p>A <em>subprogram call</em> is either a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0217">procedure_call_statement</a></code> or a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code>; [it invokes the execution of the <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code>. The call specifies the association of the actual parameters, if any, with formal parameters of the subprogram.] </p>

#### Syntax

<p><code>procedure_call_statement</code><a id="S0217"></a><code> ::= </code>    <em>procedure_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>;  | <em>procedure_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0219">actual_parameter_part</a></code>;</p>
<p><code>function_call</code><a id="S0218"></a><code> ::= </code>    <em>function_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>  | <em>function_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0219">actual_parameter_part</a></code></p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} For the purpose of non-syntax rules, infix operator calls are considered <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code>s. See 6.6. </p></Admonition>

<p><code>actual_parameter_part</code><a id="S0219"></a><code> ::= </code>    (<code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code> {"{"}, <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code>{"}"})</p>
<p><code>parameter_association</code><a id="S0220"></a><code> ::= </code>   [<em>formal_parameter_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code> ={">"}] <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0221">explicit_actual_parameter</a></code></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0416-1"}</em>{"}"} A <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code> is <em>named</em> or <em>positional</em> according to whether or not the <em>formal_parameter_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code> is specified. For the <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code>s of a single <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0219">actual_parameter_part</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-5/AA-5.5#S0188">iterator_actual_parameter_part</a></code>, any positional associations shall precede any named associations. Named associations are not allowed if the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> in a subprogram call is an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0100">attribute_reference</a></code>. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>This means that the formal parameter names used in describing predefined attributes are to aid presentation of their semantics, but are not intended for use in actual calls. </p></Admonition>


#### Name Resolution Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00310-01"}</em>{"}"} The <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> given in a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0217">procedure_call_statement</a></code> shall resolve to denote a callable entity that is a procedure, or an entry renamed as (viewed as) a procedure. The <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> given in a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code> shall resolve to denote a callable entity that is a function. The <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> shall not resolve to denote an abstract subprogram unless it is also a dispatching subprogram. [When there is an <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0219">actual_parameter_part</a></code>, the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> can be an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0095">implicit_dereference</a></code> of an access-to-subprogram value.] </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00310-01"}</em>{"}"} This rule is talking about dispatching operations (which is a static concept) and not about dispatching calls (which is a dynamic concept). </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>The function can be an operator, enumeration literal, attribute that is a function, etc. </p></Admonition>

<p>A subprogram call shall contain at most one association for each formal parameter. Each formal parameter without an association shall have a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code> (in the profile of the view denoted by the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code>). [This rule is an overloading rule (see 8.6).] </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Proof: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0240-1"}</em>{"}"} All Name Resolution Rules are overloading rules, see 8.6. </p></Admonition>


#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00407-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0416-1"}</em>{"}"} If the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> of a subprogram call denotes a prefixed view (see 4.1.3), the subprogram call is equivalent to a call on the underlying subprogram, with the first actual parameter being provided by the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> of the prefixed view (or the Access attribute of this <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> if the first formal parameter is an access parameter), and the remaining actual parameters given by the <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0219">actual_parameter_part</a></code>, if any. </p>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} For the execution of a subprogram call, the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> of the call is evaluated, and each <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code> is evaluated (see 6.4.1). If a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code> is used, an implicit <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code> is assumed for this rule. These evaluations are done in an arbitrary order. The <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code> is then executed, or a call on an entry or protected subprogram is performed (see 3.9.2). Finally, if the subprogram completes normally, then after it is left, any necessary assigning back of formal to actual parameters occurs (see 6.4.1).</p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>The implicit association for a default is only for this run-time rule. At compile time, the visibility rules are applied to the default at the place where it occurs, not at the place of a call. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>If the subprogram is inherited, see 3.4, "Derived Types and Classes".</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>If the subprogram is protected, see 9.5.1, "Protected Subprograms and Protected Actions".</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>If the subprogram is really a renaming of an entry, see 9.5.3, "Entry Calls".</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} If the subprogram is implemented by an entry or protected subprogram, it will be treated as a dispatching call to the corresponding entry (see 9.5.3, "Entry Calls") or protected subprogram (see 9.5.1, "Protected Subprograms and Protected Actions").</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00348-01"}</em>{"}"} Normally, the <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code> that is executed by the above rule is the one for the subprogram being called. For an enumeration literal, implicitly declared (but noninherited) subprogram, null procedure, or an attribute that is a subprogram, an implicit body is assumed. For a dispatching call, 3.9.2, "Dispatching Operations of Tagged Types" defines which <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code> is executed. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00318-02"}</em>{"}"} The exception Program_Error is raised at the point of a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code> if the function completes normally without executing a return statement. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>We are committing to raising the exception at the point of call, for uniformity - see AI83-00152. This happens after the function is left, of course.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>Note that there is no name for suppressing this check, since the check imposes no time overhead and minimal space overhead (since it can usually be statically eliminated as dead code). </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00231-01"}</em>{"}"} A <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code> denotes a constant, as defined in 6.5; the nominal subtype of the constant is given by the nominal subtype of the function result. </p>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>NOTE 1   If a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code> is used for two or more parameters in a multiple <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0207">parameter_specification</a></code>, the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code> is evaluated once for each omitted parameter.

#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

<Admonition type="note">
<p>We have gotten rid of parameters "of the form of a type conversion" (see RM83-6.4.1(3)). The new view semantics of <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code>s allows us to use normal <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code>s instead.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>We have moved wording about run-time semantics of parameter associations to 6.4.1.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>We have moved wording about raising Program_Error for a function that falls off the end to here from RM83-6.5. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 95

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00310-01"}</em>{"}"} Nondispatching abstract operations are no longer considered when resolving a subprogram call. That makes it possible to use <strong>abstract</strong> to "undefine" a predefined operation for an untagged type. That's especially helpful when defining custom arithmetic packages. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00231-01"}</em>{"}"} Changed the definition of the nominal subtype of a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0218">function_call</a></code> to use the nominal subtype wording of 6.1, to take into account <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#S0083">null_exclusion</a></code>s and access result types.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} Added wording to clarify that the meaning of a call on a subprogram "implemented by" an entry or protected operation is defined by 3.9.2.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00407-01"}</em>{"}"} Defined the meaning of a call on a prefixed view of a subprogram (see 4.1.3). </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2012

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0416-1"}</em>{"}"} Moved the equivalence definition for a prefixed view to Static Semantics, in order that it is clear Legality Rules that apply to calls and the parameters of calls apply to prefixed views (including the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code>). </p></Admonition>


## 6.4.1  Parameter Associations

<p>[ A parameter association defines the association between an actual parameter and a formal parameter.] </p>

#### Language Design Principles

<Admonition type="note">
<p>The parameter passing rules for <strong>out</strong> parameters are designed to ensure that the parts of a type that have implicit initial values (see 3.3.1) don't become "de-initialized" by being passed as an <strong>out</strong> parameter.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0142-4"}</em>{"}"} For explicitly aliased parameters of functions, we will ensure at the call site that a part of the parameter can be returned as part of the function result without creating a dangling pointer. We do this with accessibility checks at the call site that all actual objects of explicitly aliased parameters live at least as long as the function result; then we can allow them to be returned as access discriminants or anonymous access results, as those have the master of the function result. </p></Admonition>


#### Name Resolution Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0118-1"}</em>{"}"} The <em>formal_parameter_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0099">selector_name</a></code> of a named <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code> shall resolve to denote a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.1#S0207">parameter_specification</a></code> of the view being called; this is the formal parameter of the association. The formal parameter for a positional <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code> is the parameter with the corresponding position in the formal part of the view being called.</p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0118-1"}</em>{"}"} For positional parameters, the "corresponding position" is calculated after any transformation of prefixed views. </p></Admonition>

<p>The <em>actual parameter</em> is either the <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0221">explicit_actual_parameter</a></code> given in a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code> for a given formal parameter, or the corresponding <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code> if no <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0220">parameter_association</a></code> is given for the formal parameter. The expected type for an actual parameter is the type of the corresponding formal parameter. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>The corresponding <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.7#S0063">default_expression</a></code> is the one of the corresponding formal parameter in the profile of the view denoted by the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0093">prefix</a></code> of the call. </p></Admonition>

<p>If the mode is <strong>in</strong>, the actual is interpreted as an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code>; otherwise, the actual is interpreted only as a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>, if possible. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} This formally resolves the ambiguity present in the syntax rule for <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.4#S0221">explicit_actual_parameter</a></code>. This matters as an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> that is a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> is evaluated and represents a value while a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> by itself can be an object; if the mode is not <strong>in</strong>, we want the parameter to interpreted as an object. Note that we don't actually require that the actual be a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> if the mode is not <strong>in</strong>; we do that below.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} This wording uses "interpreted as" rather than "shall be" so that this rule is not used to resolve overloading; it is solely about evaluation as described above. We definitely do not want to allow oddities like the presence of parentheses requiring the selection of an <strong>in</strong> formal parameter as opposed to an otherwise matching <strong>in out</strong> parameter. </p></Admonition>


#### Legality Rules

<p>If the mode is <strong>in out</strong> or <strong>out</strong>, the actual shall be a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> that denotes a variable. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} We no longer need "or a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> whose argument is the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> of a variable", because a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.6#S0162">type_conversion</a></code> is now a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>, and a view conversion of a variable is a variable while any other conversion (which should not be legal here) is a constant. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Reason: </strong>The requirement that the actual be a (variable) <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> is not an overload resolution rule, since we don't want the difference between <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> and <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> to be used to resolve overloading. For example: </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
procedure Print(X : in Integer; Y : in Boolean := True);{"\n"}procedure Print(Z : in out Integer);{"\n"}. . .{"\n"}Print(3); -- Ambiguous!{"\n"}  {"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>The above call to Print is ambiguous even though the call is not compatible with the second Print which requires an actual that is a (variable) <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> ("3" is an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code>, not a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>). This requirement is a legality rule, so overload resolution fails before it is considered, meaning that the call is ambiguous. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0074-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0159-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0377-1"}</em>{"}"} If the mode is <strong>out</strong>, the actual parameter is a view conversion, and the type of the formal parameter is a scalar type, then </p>
<p>neither the target type nor the operand type has the Default_Value aspect specified; or</p>
<p>both the target type and the operand type shall have the Default_Value aspect specified, and there shall exist a type (other than a root numeric type) that is an ancestor of both the target type and the operand type. </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0074-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0159-1"}</em>{"}"} In addition to the places where Legality Rules normally apply (see 12.3), these rules also apply in the private part of an instance of a generic unit.</p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Reason: </strong>These rules are needed in order to ensure that a well-defined parameter value is passed. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0102-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0142-4"}</em>{"}"} If the formal parameter is an explicitly aliased parameter, the type of the actual parameter shall be tagged or the actual parameter shall be an aliased view of an object. Further, if the formal parameter subtype <em>F</em> is untagged:</p>
<p>the subtype <em>F</em> shall statically match the nominal subtype of the actual object; or</p>
<p>the subtype <em>F</em> shall be unconstrained, discriminated in its full view, and unconstrained in any partial view. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>Tagged objects (and tagged <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.3#S0106">aggregate</a></code>s for <strong>in</strong> parameters) do not need to be aliased. This matches the behavior of unaliased formal parameters of tagged types, which allow 'Access to be taken of the formal parameter regardless of the form of the actual parameter. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Reason: </strong>We need the subtype check on untagged actual parameters so that the requirements of 'Access are not lost. 'Access makes its checks against the nominal subtype of its prefix, and parameter passing can change that subtype. But we don't want this parameter passing to change the objects that would be allowed as the prefix of 'Access.

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>Since explicitly aliased parameters are either tagged or required to be objects, there is always an object (possibly anonymous) to talk about.

Even when the result is expected to be the same in both parameters, the code is unnecessarily tricky. Programs which fail this new check should be rare and are easily fixed by adding a temporary object. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2005

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0008-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> A missing rule was added to cover cases that were missed in Ada 95 and Ada 2005; specifically, that an <strong>in</strong> parameter passed by reference might have its discriminants changed via another path. Such cases are erroneous as requiring compilers to detect such errors would be expensive, and requiring such cases to work would be a major change of the user model (<strong>in</strong> parameters with discriminants could no longer be assumed constant). This is not an inconsistency, as compilers are not required to change any current behavior.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0102-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Moved implicit conversion Legality Rule to 8.6.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0118-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Added a definition for positional parameters, as this is missing from Ada 95 and later.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0142-4"}</em>{"}"} Rules have been added defining the legality and dynamic checks needed for explicitly aliased parameters (see 6.1).</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0144-2"}</em>{"}"} Additional rules have been added such that passing an object to an <strong>in out</strong> or <strong>out</strong> parameter of a function is illegal if it is used elsewhere in a construct which allows evaluation in an arbitrary order. Such calls are not portable (since the results may depend on the evaluation order), and the results could even vary because of optimization settings and the like. Thus they've been banned. </p></Admonition>


#### Inconsistencies With Ada 2012

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0378-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Added a permission to pass <strong>null</strong> so that value passed into an <strong>out</strong> parameter for access types is well-defined in the case of a view conversion. <strong>Null</strong> may be passed for any view conversion between unrelated access types; this is important for conversions that may have problematic accessibility or tags. If the permission is used and the <strong>out</strong> parameter is read before it is written (perhaps to read a bound or discriminant), Constraint_Error may be raised by Ada 2022 when it would not have been in Ada 2012. Additionally, if the called subprogram does not write the <strong>out</strong> parameter at all, the actual object will be overwritten with <strong>null</strong> (and possibly raise Constraint_Error if the object is null excluding), while the object would be unchanged in Ada 2012. Such cases are thought to be rare, as most <strong>out</strong> parameters of access types are overwritten before being read. In addition, at least one widely-used Ada compiler already passes <strong>null</strong> in these cases. </p></Admonition>


#### Incompatibilities With Ada 2012

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0074-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0159-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0377-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0378-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Added rules to ensure that the value passed into an <strong>out</strong> parameter for scalar types is well-defined in the case of a view conversion. The new rules can be incompatible. View conversions from/to an unrelated type with the Default_Value aspect specified are unlikely to occur in existing code, as the aspect is new in Ada 2012. Declaring and passing a temporary rather than a view conversion will eliminate the problem.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0095-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Because of a rule added in 12.5.1, the checks for the passing of an object to an explicitly aliased parameter in a generic body were strengthened to use an assume the worst rule. This case is rather unlikely as a formal private or derived type with discriminants is required along with an explicitly aliased parameter whose type doesn't statically match the formal type. Such a program is very unlikely, especially as explicitly aliased parameters are a new Ada 2012 feature. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2012

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0216-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> The <strong>in out</strong> parameter rule only applies to actual parameters of elementary types. While this allows additional programs (and thus could be considered an extension), it is unlikely to change anything in a real program (it could only matter in a call with 4 or more parameters, and then only if two composite parameters have matching actuals). Thus we document it as a wording change.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0333-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Predicate checks are not made for inbound <strong>out</strong> parameters. The actual rule change that has this effect is found in 4.6 and is documented there. </p></Admonition>
