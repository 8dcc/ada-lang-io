<p>This subclause defines restrictions that can be used with pragma Restrictions (see <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.12">13.12</a>); these facilitate the demonstration of program correctness by allowing tailored versions of the run-time system. <br /></p>

<strong></strong>Note that the restrictions are absolute. If a partition has 100 library units and just one needs Unchecked_Conversion, then the pragma cannot be used to ensure the other 99 units do not use Unchecked_Conversion. Note also that these are restrictions on all Ada code within a partition, and therefore it might not be evident from the specification of a package whether a restriction can be imposed.<br /></Admonition>

Restrictions against individual aspects, pragmas, and attributes do not apply to the run-time system, in order that an implementation can use whatever aspects, pragmas, and attributes are needed to do the job. For instance, attempting to write a run-time system for Linux that does not use the Import aspect would be very difficult and probably is not what the user is trying to prevent anyway. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0318-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction">
<strong></strong> Restriction No_IO now excludes use of Ada.Directories. If a program using No_IO used Ada.Directories, it would be legal in Ada 2012 and illegal in Ada 2022. However, given the role of Ada.Directories as a support package for the other packages that are excluded by No_IO, it seems unlikely that any use of the restriction would use this package (and it's possible that implementations wouldn't support its use with No_IO anyway). <br /></Admonition>

#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>1/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0256-1", "AI12-0403-1"]} />
<p>For a type, the following type-related, operational aspect may be specified:<br /></p>

<MarginText>2/5</MarginText>
<dt><br/>No_Controlled_Parts</dt>
<dl>
<dd>The type of this aspect is Boolean. If True, the type and any descendants shall not have any controlled parts. If specified, the value of the expression shall be static. If not specified, the value of this aspect is False.<br /></dd>

<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0256-1"]} />
<p>The No_Controlled_Parts aspect is nonoverridable (see <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#Subclause_13.1.1">13.1.1</a>).<br /></p>

<MarginText>3.a/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0407-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<strong></strong>Since this is a Boolean-valued aspect, the blanket restrictions defined by <a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#Subclause_13.1.1">13.1.1</a> apply to the specification of Boolean-valued aspects on descendants of types with such aspects. But we still need rules about inheritance from progenitors and about hiding the aspect; it would be too painful to repeat those rules here (and have future maintenance fixes not get applied to this aspect). <br /></Admonition>

#### Legality Rules

<MarginText>4/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0256-1", "AI12-0407-1"]} />
<p>If No_Controlled_Parts is True for a type, no component of the type shall have a controlled part nor shall the type itself be controlled. For the purposes of this rule, a type has a controlled part if its full type has a controlled part; this is applied recursively. In addition to the places where Legality Rules normally apply (see <a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3">12.3</a>), this rule also applies in the private part of an instance of a generic unit.<br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>4.a/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0407-1"]} />
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion">
<strong></strong>This check breaks privacy by looking at the full definition of all of the types involved. This is more like a representation aspect than an operational aspect, but representation aspects are not allowed on partial views and we need this aspect to be visible to clients. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>5/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0256-1", "AI12-0407-1"]} />
<p>When enforcing the above rule within a generic body <em>G</em> or within the body of a generic unit declared within the declarative region of generic unit <em>G</em>, a generic formal private type of <em>G</em> and a generic formal derived type of <em>G</em> whose ancestor is a tagged type whose No_Controlled_Parts aspect is False are considered to have a controlled part.<br /></p>
