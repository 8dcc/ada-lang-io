# J.6  Numeric_Error

We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.

#### Static Semantics

<p>The following declaration exists in the declaration of package Standard: </p>
<CodeBlock>
Numeric_Error : exception renames Constraint_Error;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>This is true even though it is not shown in A.1. </p>
<p><strong>Reason: </strong>In Ada 83, it was unclear which situations should raise Numeric_Error, and which should raise Constraint_Error. The permissions of RM83-11.6 could often be used to allow the implementation to raise Constraint_Error in a situation where one would normally expect Numeric_Error. To avoid this confusion, all situations that raise Numeric_Error in Ada 83 are changed to raise Constraint_Error in Ada 95. Numeric_Error is changed to be a renaming of Constraint_Error to avoid most of the upward compatibilities associated with this change.</p>
<p>In new code, Constraint_Error should be used instead of Numeric_Error. </p>
