#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />For the first subtype S of a type <em>T</em> declared by an <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#S0085">incomplete_type_declaration</a></code> that is not tagged, the following attribute is defined: <br /></p>

<dt><br/>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />S'Class </dt>
<dl>
<dd>Denotes the first subtype of the incomplete class-wide type rooted at <em>T</em>. The completion of <em>T</em> shall declare a tagged type. Such an attribute reference shall occur in the same library unit as the <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#S0085">incomplete_type_declaration</a></code>. <br /></dd>
</dl>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />This must occur in the same unit to prevent children from imposing requirements on their ancestor library units for deferred incomplete types. <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />This subclause is new. This feature was moved here because the tagged incomplete type provides a better way to provide this capability (it doesn't put requirements on the completion based on uses that could be anywhere). Pity we didn't think of it in 1994. <br /></Admonition>
