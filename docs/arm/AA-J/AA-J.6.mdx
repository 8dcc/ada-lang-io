#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>The following declaration exists in the declaration of package Standard: <br /></p>

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<CodeBlock language="ada">
Numeric_Error : exception renames Constraint_Error;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<MarginText>2.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>This is true even though it is not shown in <a href="../AA-A/AA-A.1">A.1</a>. <br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>2.b</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>In Ada 83, it was unclear which situations should raise Numeric_Error, and which should raise Constraint_Error. The permissions of RM83-11.6 could often be used to allow the implementation to raise Constraint_Error in a situation where one would normally expect Numeric_Error. To avoid this confusion, all situations that raise Numeric_Error in Ada 83 are changed to raise Constraint_Error in Ada 95. Numeric_Error is changed to be a renaming of Constraint_Error to avoid most of the upward compatibilities associated with this change.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>2.c</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
In new code, Constraint_Error should be used instead of Numeric_Error. <br /></Admonition>
