# J.9 The Storage_Size Attribute

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.

#### Static Semantics

<p>For any task subtype T, the following attribute is defined: <br /></p>

<p>T'Storage_Size Denotes an implementation-defined value of type <em>universal_integer</em> representing the number of storage elements reserved for a task of the subtype T. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} T'Storage_Size cannot be particularly meaningful in the presence of the specification of the aspect Storage_Size, especially when the expression is dynamic, or depends on a discriminant of the task, because the Storage_Size will be different for different objects of the type. Even without such a specification, the Storage_Size can be different for different objects of the type, and in any case, the value is implementation defined. Hence, it is always implementation defined. <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} Storage_Size may be specified for a task first subtype that is not an interface via an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code>. When the attribute is specified, the Storage_Size aspect is specified to be the value of the given <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code>. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} When this attribute is specified with an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code>, the associated aspect is set to the <em>value</em> of the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> given in the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code>, rather than the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> itself. This value is therefore the same for all objects of the type; in particular, it is not re-evaluated when objects are created. This is different than when the aspect is specified with an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> (see 13.3). <br /></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00345-01"}</em>{"}"} We don't allow specifying Storage_Size on task interfaces. We don't need to mention class-wide task types, because these cannot be a first subtype. <br /></Admonition>
