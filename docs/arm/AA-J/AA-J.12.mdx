# J.12 Pragma Interface

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.
See the [tracking issue](https://github.com/ada-lang-io/ada-lang-io/issues/20)

#### Syntax

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00284-02"}</em>{"}"} In addition to an identifier, the reserved word <strong>interface</strong> is allowed as a pragma name, to provide compatibility with a prior edition of this Reference Manual. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Implementation Note: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00284-02"}</em>{"}"} All implementations need to at least recognize and ignore this pragma. A syntax error is not an acceptable implementation of this pragma. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} This subclause is new. This is necessary as <strong>interface</strong> is now a reserved word, which would prevent pragma Interface from being an implementation-defined pragma. We don't define any semantics for this pragma, as we expect that implementations will continue to use whatever they currently implement - requiring any changes would be counter-productive. </p></Admonition>
