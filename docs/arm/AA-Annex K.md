# Annex K Language-Defined Attributes

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.
See the [tracking issue](https://github.com/ada-lang-io/ada-lang-io/issues/20)
:::
All_Calls_Remote See E.2.3.

CPU See D.13.

No_Return See 6.5.1.

This annex summarizes the definitions given elsewhere of the language-defined attributes.

P'AccessFor a [prefix](S0086) P that denotes a subprogram:

See 3.10.2.

X'AccessFor a [prefix](S0086) X that denotes an aliased view of an object:

See 3.10.2.

X'AddressFor a prefix X that denotes an object, program unit, or label:

Denotes the address of the first of the storage elements allocated to X. For a program unit or label, this value refers to the machine code associated with the corresponding body or [statement](S0124). The value of this attribute is of type System.Address. See 13.3.

S'AdjacentFor every subtype S of a floating point type T:

S'Adjacent denotes a function with the following specification: 

```ada
function S'Adjacent (X, Towards : T)
  return T

```

If Towards = X, the function yields X; otherwise, it yields the machine number of the type T adjacent to X in the direction of Towards, if that machine number exists. If the result would be outside the base range of S, Constraint_Error is raised. When T'Signed_Zeros is True, a zero result has the sign of X. When Towards is zero, its sign has no bearing on the result. See A.5.3.

S'AftFor every fixed point subtype S:

S'Aft yields the number of decimal digits needed after the decimal point to accommodate the delta of the subtype S, unless the delta of the subtype S is greater than 0.1, in which case the attribute yields the value one. (S'Aft is the smallest positive integer N for which (10**N)*S'Delta is greater than or equal to one.) The value of this attribute is of the type universal_integer. See 3.5.10.

X'AlignmentFor a prefix X that denotes a subtype or object:

The Address of an object that is allocated under control of the implementation is an integral multiple of the Alignment of the object (that is, the Address modulo the Alignment is zero).The offset of a record component is a multiple of the Alignment of the component. For an object that is not allocated under control of the implementation (that is, one that is imported, that is allocated by a user-defined allocator, whose Address has been specified, or is designated by an access value returned by an instance of Unchecked_Conversion), the implementation may assume that the Address is an integral multiple of its Alignment. The implementation shall not assume a stricter alignment.

The value of this attribute is of type universal_integer, and nonnegative; zero means that the object is not necessarily aligned on a storage element boundary. See 13.3.

S'BaseFor every scalar subtype S:

S'Base denotes an unconstrained subtype of the type of S. This unconstrained subtype is called the base subtype of the type. See 3.5.

E'CallerFor a [prefix](S0086) E that denotes an [entry_declaration](S0187):

Yields a value of the type Task_Id that identifies the task whose call is now being serviced. Use of this attribute is allowed only inside an [entry_body](S0190) or [accept_statement](S0188)corresponding to the [entry_declaration](S0187) denoted by E. See C.7.1.

```ada
function S'Ceiling (X : T)
  return T

```

The function yields the value X, i.e., the smallest (most negative) integral value greater than or equal to X. When X is zero, the result has the sign of X; a zero result otherwise has a negative sign when S'Signed_Zeros is True. See A.5.3.

S'ClassFor every subtype S of a tagged type T (specific or class-wide):

S'Class denotes a subtype of the class-wide type (called T'Class in this document) for the class rooted at T (or if S already denotes a class-wide subtype, then S'Class is the same as S).

S'Class is unconstrained. However, if S is constrained, then the values of S'Class are only those that when converted to the type T belong to S. See 3.9.

S'ClassFor every subtype S of an untagged private type whose full view is tagged:

Denotes the class-wide subtype corresponding to the full view of S. This attribute is allowed only from the beginning of the private part in which the full view is declared, until the declaration of the full view. After the full view, the Class attribute of the full view can be used. See 7.3.1.

X'Unchecked_AccessFor a [prefix](S0086) X that denotes an aliased view of an object:

All rules and semantics that apply to X'Access (see 3.10.2) apply also to X'Unchecked_Access, except that, for the purposes of accessibility rules and checks, it is as if X were declared immediately within a library package. See 13.10.

S'ValFor every discrete subtype S:

S'Val denotes a function with the following specification: 

```ada
function S'Val(Arg : universal_integer)

P'VersionFor a prefix P that statically denotes a program unit:

Yields a value of the predefined type String that identifies the version of the compilation unit that contains the declaration of the program unit. See E.3.

S'Wide_ImageFor NONE!:

See 4.9.1.

S'Wide_ValueFor every scalar subtype S:

S'Wide_Value denotes a function with the following specification:
