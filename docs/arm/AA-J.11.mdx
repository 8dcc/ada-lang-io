# J.11  The Class Attribute of Untagged Incomplete Types

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.
See the [tracking issue](https://github.com/ada-lang-io/ada-lang-io/issues/20)

#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} For the first subtype S of a type <em>T</em> declared by an <code><a href="./AA-3.10#S0085">incomplete_type_declaration</a></code> that is not tagged, the following attribute is defined: </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} S'Class Denotes the first subtype of the incomplete class-wide type rooted at <em>T</em>. The completion of <em>T</em> shall declare a tagged type. Such an attribute reference shall occur in the same library unit as the <code><a href="./AA-3.10#S0085">incomplete_type_declaration</a></code>. </p>
<p><strong>Reason: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} This must occur in the same unit to prevent children from imposing requirements on their ancestor library units for deferred incomplete types. </p>

#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00326-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} This subclause is new. This feature was moved here because the tagged incomplete type provides a better way to provide this capability (it doesn't put requirements on the completion based on uses that could be anywhere). Pity we didn't think of it in 1994. </p>
