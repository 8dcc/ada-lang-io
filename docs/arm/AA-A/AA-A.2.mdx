#### Static Semantics

<p>The following language-defined library package exists: <br /></p>

<CodeBlock>
--  {"{"}{"AI12-0414-1"}{"}"}{"\n"} package Ada{"\n"}   with Pure is{"\n"}end Ada;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0414-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Ada serves as the parent of most of the other language-defined library units; its declaration is empty. <br /></p>


#### Legality Rules

<p>In the standard mode, it is illegal to compile a child of package Ada. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>The intention is that mentioning, say, Ada.Text_IO in a <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0294">with_clause</a></code> is guaranteed (at least in the standard mode) to refer to the standard version of Ada.Text_IO. The user can compile a root library unit Text_IO that has no relation to the standard version of Text_IO. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>Note that Ada can have non-language-defined grandchildren, assuming the implementation allows it. Also, packages System and Interfaces can have children, assuming the implementation allows it. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>An implementation will typically support a nonstandard mode in which compiling the language defined library units is allowed. Whether or not this mode is made available to users is up to the implementer.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
An implementation could theoretically have private children of Ada, since that would be semantically neutral. However, a programmer cannot compile such a library unit. <br /></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />This subclause is new to Ada 95. <br /></Admonition>
