# A.2 The Package Ada

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.

#### Static Semantics

<p>The following language-defined library package exists: </p>
<CodeBlock>
{"{"}{"AI12-0414-1"}{"}"} package Ada{"\n"}   with Pure is{"\n"}end Ada;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0414-1"}</em>{"}"} Ada serves as the parent of most of the other language-defined library units; its declaration is empty. </p>

#### Legality Rules

<p>In the standard mode, it is illegal to compile a child of package Ada. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Reason: </strong>The intention is that mentioning, say, Ada.Text_IO in a <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0294">with_clause</a></code> is guaranteed (at least in the standard mode) to refer to the standard version of Ada.Text_IO. The user can compile a root library unit Text_IO that has no relation to the standard version of Text_IO. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>Note that Ada can have non-language-defined grandchildren, assuming the implementation allows it. Also, packages System and Interfaces can have children, assuming the implementation allows it. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Implementation Note: </strong>An implementation will typically support a nonstandard mode in which compiling the language defined library units is allowed. Whether or not this mode is made available to users is up to the implementer.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>An implementation could theoretically have private children of Ada, since that would be semantically neutral. However, a programmer cannot compile such a library unit. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 83

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} This subclause is new to Ada 95. </p></Admonition>
