<p>The packages Wide_Text_IO and Wide_Wide_Text_IO provide facilities for input and output in human-readable form. Each file is read or written sequentially, as a sequence of wide characters (or wide wide characters) grouped into lines, and as a sequence of lines grouped into pages. <br /></p>


#### Static Semantics

<MarginText>2/2</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI95-00285-01", "AI95-00301-01"]} />
<p>The specification of package Wide_Text_IO is the same as that for Text_IO, except that in each Get, Look_Ahead, Get_Immediate, Get_Line, Put, and Put_Line subprogram, any occurrence of Character is replaced by Wide_Character, and any occurrence of String is replaced by Wide_String. Nongeneric equivalents of Wide_Text_IO.Integer_IO and Wide_Text_IO.Float_IO are provided (as for Text_IO) for each predefined numeric type, with names such as Ada.Integer_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Long_Integer_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Float_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Long_Float_Wide_Text_IO.<br /></p>

<MarginText>3/2</MarginText>

<p>The specification of package Wide_Wide_Text_IO is the same as that for Text_IO, except that in each Get, Look_Ahead, Get_Immediate, Get_Line, Put, and Put_Line subprogram, any occurrence of Character is replaced by Wide_Wide_Character, and any occurrence of String is replaced by Wide_Wide_String. Nongeneric equivalents of Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Integer_IO and Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Float_IO are provided (as for Text_IO) for each predefined numeric type, with names such as Ada.Integer_Wide_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Long_Integer_Wide_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Float_Wide_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Long_Float_Wide_Wide_Text_IO.<br /></p>

<p>The specification of package Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Bounded_IO is the same as that for Text_IO.Bounded_IO, except that any occurrence of Bounded_String is replaced by Bounded_Wide_String, and any occurrence of package Bounded is replaced by Wide_Bounded. The specification of package Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Wide_Bounded_IO is the same as that for Text_IO.Bounded_IO, except that any occurrence of Bounded_String is replaced by Bounded_Wide_Wide_String, and any occurrence of package Bounded is replaced by Wide_Wide_Bounded.<br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>&ldquo;package Bounded&rdquo; refers to both the package Ada.Strings.Bounded and the formal package parameter named Bounded. <br /></Admonition>

<p>The specification of package Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Unbounded_IO is the same as that for Text_IO.Unbounded_IO, except that any occurrence of Unbounded_String is replaced by Unbounded_Wide_String, and any occurrence of package Unbounded is replaced by Wide_Unbounded. The specification of package Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Wide_Unbounded_IO is the same as that for Text_IO.Unbounded_IO, except that any occurrence of Unbounded_String is replaced by Unbounded_Wide_Wide_String, and any occurrence of package Unbounded is replaced by Wide_Wide_Unbounded. <br /></p>


#### Extensions to Ada 83
