# A.11 Wide Text Input-Output and Wide Wide Text Input-Output

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00285-01"}</em>{"}"} The packages Wide_Text_IO and Wide_Wide_Text_IO provide facilities for input and output in human-readable form. Each file is read or written sequentially, as a sequence of wide characters (or wide wide characters) grouped into lines, and as a sequence of lines grouped into pages. </p>

#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00285-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00301-01"}</em>{"}"} The specification of package Wide_Text_IO is the same as that for Text_IO, except that in each Get, Look_Ahead, Get_Immediate, Get_Line, Put, and Put_Line subprogram, any occurrence of Character is replaced by Wide_Character, and any occurrence of String is replaced by Wide_String. Nongeneric equivalents of Wide_Text_IO.Integer_IO and Wide_Text_IO.Float_IO are provided (as for Text_IO) for each predefined numeric type, with names such as Ada.Integer_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Long_Integer_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Float_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Long_Float_Wide_Text_IO.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00285-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00301-01"}</em>{"}"} The specification of package Wide_Wide_Text_IO is the same as that for Text_IO, except that in each Get, Look_Ahead, Get_Immediate, Get_Line, Put, and Put_Line subprogram, any occurrence of Character is replaced by Wide_Wide_Character, and any occurrence of String is replaced by Wide_Wide_String. Nongeneric equivalents of Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Integer_IO and Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Float_IO are provided (as for Text_IO) for each predefined numeric type, with names such as Ada.Integer_Wide_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Long_Integer_Wide_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Float_Wide_Wide_Text_IO, Ada.Long_Float_Wide_Wide_Text_IO.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00285-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00428-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0004-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0092-1"}</em>{"}"} The specification of package Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Bounded_IO is the same as that for Text_IO.Bounded_IO, except that any occurrence of Bounded_String is replaced by Bounded_Wide_String, and any occurrence of package Bounded is replaced by Wide_Bounded. The specification of package Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Wide_Bounded_IO is the same as that for Text_IO.Bounded_IO, except that any occurrence of Bounded_String is replaced by Bounded_Wide_Wide_String, and any occurrence of package Bounded is replaced by Wide_Wide_Bounded.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} "package Bounded" refers to both the package Ada.Strings.Bounded and the formal package parameter named Bounded. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00285-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00301-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0092-1"}</em>{"}"} The specification of package Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Unbounded_IO is the same as that for Text_IO.Unbounded_IO, except that any occurrence of Unbounded_String is replaced by Unbounded_Wide_String, and any occurrence of package Unbounded is replaced by Wide_Unbounded. The specification of package Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Wide_Unbounded_IO is the same as that for Text_IO.Unbounded_IO, except that any occurrence of Unbounded_String is replaced by Unbounded_Wide_Wide_String, and any occurrence of package Unbounded is replaced by Wide_Wide_Unbounded. </p>

#### Extensions to Ada 83

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Support for Wide_Character and Wide_String I/O is new in Ada 95. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00285-01"}</em>{"}"} Package Wide_Wide_Text_IO is new. Be glad it wasn't called Double_Wide_Text_IO (for use in trailer parks) or Really_Wide_Text_IO.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00301-01"}</em>{"}"} Packages Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Unbounded_IO and Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Wide_Unbounded_IO are also new.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00428-01"}</em>{"}"} Packages Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Bounded_IO and Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Wide_Wide_Bounded_IO are new as well. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2005

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0092-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction</strong>: Corrected the names of various entities in the above description. Since the previously named entities don't exist and the intent is obvious, this is just considered a presentation change. </p></Admonition>
