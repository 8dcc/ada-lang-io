<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00248-01"}</em>{"}"} External files may be classified as directories, special files, or ordinary files. A <em>directory</em> is an external file that is a container for files on the target system. A <em>special file</em> is an external file that cannot be created or read by a predefined Ada input-output package. External files that are not special files or directories are called <em>ordinary files</em>. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>A directory is an external file, although it may not have a name on some targets. A directory is not a special file, as it can be created and read by Directories. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>Devices and soft links are examples of special files on Windows® and Unix.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Even if an implementation provides a package to create and read soft links, such links are still special files. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00248-01"}</em>{"}"} A <em>file name</em> is a string identifying an external file. Similarly, a <em>directory name</em> is a string identifying a directory. The interpretation of file names and directory names is implementation defined. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-defined" title="Implementation defined: ">
<p><strong></strong>The interpretation of file names and directory names.</p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00248-01"}</em>{"}"} The <em>full name</em> of an external file is a full specification of the name of the file. If the external environment allows alternative specifications of the name (for example, abbreviations), the full name should not use such alternatives. A full name typically will include the names of all of the directories that contain the item. The <em>simple name</em> of an external file is the name of the item, not including any containing directory names. Unless otherwise specified, a file name or directory name parameter in a call to a predefined Ada input-output subprogram can be a full name, a simple name, or any other form of name supported by the implementation. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>The full name on Unix is a complete path to the root. For Windows®, the full name includes a complete path, as well as a disk name ("C:") or network share name. For both systems, the simple name is the part of the name following the last '/' (or '\' for Windows®). For example, in the name "/usr/randy/ada-directories.ads", "ada-directories.ads" is the simple name. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>It is possible for a file or directory name to be neither a full name nor a simple name. For instance, the Unix name "../parent/myfile" is neither a full name nor a simple name. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0337-1"}</em>{"}"} A <em>root directory</em> is a directory that has no containing directory.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<p><strong></strong>For Unix and Unix-like systems, "/" is the root. For Windows®, "C:\" and "\\Computer\Share" are roots. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00248-01"}</em>{"}"} The <em>default directory</em> is the directory that is used if a directory or file name is not a full name (that is, when the name does not fully identify all of the containing directories). </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>The default directory is the one maintained by the familiar "cd" command on Unix and Windows®. Note that Windows® maintains separate default directories for each disk drive; implementations should use the natural implementation. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00248-01"}</em>{"}"} A <em>directory entry</em> is a single item in a directory, identifying a single external file (including directories and special files). </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00248-01"}</em>{"}"} For each function that returns a string, the lower bound of the returned value is 1.</p>

<CodeBlock>
function Current_Directory return String;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Returns the full directory name for the current default directory. The name returned shall be suitable for a future call to Set_Directory. The exception Use_Error is propagated if a default directory is not supported by the external environment.</p>
<CodeBlock>
procedure Set_Directory (Directory : in String);{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Sets the current default directory. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Directory does not identify an existing directory. The exception Use_Error is propagated if the external environment does not support making Directory (in the absence of Name_Error) a default directory.</p>
<CodeBlock>
procedure Create_Directory (New_Directory : in String;{"\n"}                            Form          : in String := "");{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Creates a directory with name New_Directory. The Form parameter can be used to give system-dependent characteristics of the directory; the interpretation of the Form parameter is implementation defined. A null string for Form specifies the use of the default options of the implementation of the new directory. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as New_Directory does not allow the identification of a directory. The exception Use_Error is propagated if the external environment does not support the creation of a directory with the given name (in the absence of Name_Error) and form.</p>
<CodeBlock>
procedure Delete_Directory (Directory : in String);{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0231-1"}</em>{"}"} Deletes an existing empty directory with name Directory. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Directory does not identify an existing directory. The exception Use_Error is propagated if the directory is not empty or the external environment does not support the deletion of the directory with the given name (in the absence of Name_Error).</p>

</CodeBlock>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0271-1"}</em>{"}"} Creates zero or more directories with name New_Directory. Each nonexistent directory named by New_Directory is created.[ For example, on a typical Unix system, Create_Path ("/usr/me/my"); would create directory "me" in directory "usr", then create directory "my" in directory "me".] The Form parameter can be used to give system-dependent characteristics of the directory; the interpretation of the Form parameter is implementation defined. A null string for Form specifies the use of the default options of the implementation of the new directory. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as New_Directory does not allow the identification of any directory. The exception Use_Error is propagated if the external environment does not support the creation of any directories with the given name (in the absence of Name_Error) and form. If Use_Error is propagated, it is unspecified whether a portion of the directory path is created.</p>
<CodeBlock>
procedure Delete_Tree (Directory : in String);{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Deletes an existing directory with name Directory. The directory and all of its contents (possibly including other directories) are deleted. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Directory does not identify an existing directory. The exception Use_Error is propagated if the external environment does not support the deletion of the directory or some portion of its contents with the given name (in the absence of Name_Error). If Use_Error is propagated, it is unspecified whether a portion of the contents of the directory is deleted.</p>
<CodeBlock>
procedure Delete_File (Name : in String);{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Deletes an existing ordinary or special file with name Name. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Name does not identify an existing ordinary or special external file. The exception Use_Error is propagated if the external environment does not support the deletion of the file with the given name (in the absence of Name_Error).</p>
<CodeBlock>
procedure Rename (Old_Name, New_Name : in String);{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0231-1"}</em>{"}"} Renames an existing external file (including directories) with name Old_Name to New_Name. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Old_Name does not identify an existing external file or if the string given as New_Name does not allow the identification of an external file. The exception Use_Error is propagated if the external environment does not support the renaming of the file with the given name (in the absence of Name_Error). In particular, Use_Error is propagated if a file or directory already exists with name New_Name.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<p><strong></strong>This operation is expected to work within a single directory, and implementers are encouraged to support it across directories on a single device. Copying files from one device to another is discouraged (that's what Copy_File is for). However, there is no requirement to detect file copying by the target system. If the target system has an API that gives that for "free", it can be used. For Windows®, for instance, MoveFile can be used to implement Rename. </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
{"{"}{"AI05-0092-1"}{"}"} procedure Copy_File (Source_Name,{"\n"}                     Target_Name : in String;{"\n"}                     Form        : in String := "");{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0271-1"}</em>{"}"} Copies the contents of the existing external file with name Source_Name to an external file with name Target_Name. The resulting external file is a duplicate of the source external file. The Form parameter can be used to give system-dependent characteristics of the resulting external file; the interpretation of the Form parameter is implementation defined. Exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Source_Name does not identify an existing external ordinary or special file, or if the string given as Target_Name does not allow the identification of an external file. The exception Use_Error is propagated if the external environment does not support creating the file with the name given by Target_Name and form given by Form, or copying of the file with the name given by Source_Name (in the absence of Name_Error). If Use_Error is propagated, it is unspecified whether a portion of the file is copied. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>Name_Error is always raised if Source_Name identifies a directory. It is up to the implementation whether special files can be copied, or if Use_Error will be raised. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00248-01"}</em>{"}"} The following file and directory name operations are provided:</p>
<CodeBlock>
function Full_Name (Name : in String) return String;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Returns the full name corresponding to the file name specified by Name. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Name does not allow the identification of an external file (including directories and special files). </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>Full name means that no abbreviations are used in the returned name, and that it is a full specification of the name. Thus, for Unix and Windows®, the result should be a full path that does not contain any "." or ".." directories. Typically, the default directory is used to fill in any missing information. </p></Admonition>

</CodeBlock>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0337-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0433-1"}</em>{"}"} Returns the simple name portion of the file name specified by Name. The simple name of a root directory is a name of the root itself. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Name does not allow the identification of an external file (including directories and special files).</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0337-1"}</em>{"}"} The result of Simple_Name corresponds to the result of the "basename" command on Linux and Unix. If the filename ends with a '/', and is not a root, then "basename" returns the part in front of all of the trailing '/'s. It returns a root intact. The null string is never returned. Similar rules should be used for Windows filenames. </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
function Containing_Directory (Name : in String) return String;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Returns the name of the containing directory of the external file (including directories) identified by Name. (If more than one directory can contain Name, the directory name returned is implementation defined.) The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Name does not allow the identification of an external file. The exception Use_Error is propagated if the external file does not have a containing directory. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>This is purely a string manipulation function. If Name is not given as a full name, the containing directory probably won't be one, either. For example, if Containing_Directory ("..\AARM\RM-A-8") is called on Windows®, the result should be "..\AARM". If there is no path at all on the name, the result should be "." (which represents the current directory). Use Full_Name on the result of Containing_Directory if the full name is needed. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0337-1"}</em>{"}"} Containing_Directory raises Use_Error when passed a string representing a root directory. </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
function Extension (Name : in String) return String;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Returns the extension name corresponding to Name. The extension name is a portion of a simple name (not including any separator characters), typically used to identify the file class. If the external environment does not have extension names, then the null string is returned. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Name does not allow the identification of an external file. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>For Unix and Windows®, the extension is the portion of the simple name following the rightmost period. For example, in the simple name "RM-A-8.html", the extension is "html". </p></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
function Base_Name (Name : in String) return String;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Returns the base name corresponding to Name. The base name is the remainder of a simple name after removing any extension and extension separators. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Name does not allow the identification of an external file (including directories and special files). </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>For Unix and Windows®, the base name is the portion of the simple name preceding the rightmost period (except for the special directory names "." and "..", whose Base_Name is "." and ".."). For example, in the simple name "RM-A-8.html", the base name is "RM-A-8". </p></Admonition>

<p>the string given as Containing_Directory is not null and does not allow the identification of a directory;</p>
<p>the string given as Extension is not null and is not a possible extension;</p>
<p>the string given as Name is not a possible simple name (if Extension is null) or base name (if Extension is nonnull); or</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0337-1"}</em>{"}"} the string given as Name is a root directory, and Containing_Directory or Extension is nonnull. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>The above definition implies that if the Extension is null, for Unix and Windows® no '.' is added to Name. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>If Name is null, Name_Error should be raised, as nothing is not a possible simple name or base name.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Generally, Compose(Containing_Directory(F), Base_Name(F),Extension(F)) = F. However, this is not true on Unix or Windows® for file names that end with a '.'; Compose(Base_Name("Fooey."),Extension("Fooey.")) = "Fooey". This is not a problem for Windows®, as the names have the same meaning with or without the '.', but these are different names for Unix. Thus, care needs to be taken on Unix; if Extension is null, Base_Name should be avoided. (That's not usually a problem with file names generated by a program.) </p></Admonition>

Returns Case_Sensitive if file names that differ only in the case of letters are considered different names. If file names that differ only in the case of letters are considered the same name, then Case_Preserving is returned if names have the case of the file name used when a file is created; and Case_Insensitive is returned otherwise.

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0231-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction</strong>: Clarified when and which exceptions are raised for Start_Search, Search, Delete_Directory, and Rename. If an implementation followed the original incorrect wording, it might raise Use_Error instead of Name_Error for Start_Search and Search, Name_Error instead of Use_Error for Rename, and might have deleted a nonempty directory instead of raising Use_Error for Delete_Directory. The first two cases are very unlikely to matter in practice, and it unlikely that an implementation would have followed the latter implementation strategy, as it would be more work and would make Delete_Directory identical to Delete_Tree (which is obvious nonsense). </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0337-1"}</em>{"}"} We can say more about the details of these operations by adopting the notation of a subscript to specify how many path fragments a particular result has. Then, we can abbreviate "Full Name" as "Full" and "Relative Name" as "Rel". In this notation, Unix file name "a/b" is a Rel(2), "../c/d" is a Rel(3), and "/a/b" is a Full(2). Rel(1) is equivalent to a simple name that is not a root; thus we don't have to describe that separately.</p></Admonition>

#### Implementation Advice

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0049-1"}</em>{"}"} Directories.Hierarchical_File_Names should be provided for systems with hierarchical file naming, and should not be provided on other systems. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-advice" title="Implementation Advice">
<p><strong></strong>Directories.Hierarchical_File_Names should be provided for systems with hierarchical file naming, and should not be provided on other systems.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<p><strong></strong>This package should be provided when targeting Microsoft® Windows®, Unix, Linux, and most Unix-like systems. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 1   {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0049-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0442-1"}</em>{"}"} These operations operate on file names, not external files. The files identified by these operations do not necessarily exist. Name_Error is raised only as specified or if the file name is malformed and cannot possibly identify a file. The result of these operations depends only on their parameters.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 2   {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0049-1"}</em>{"}"} Containing_Directory raises Use_Error if Name does not have a containing directory, including when any of Is_Simple_Name, Is_Root_Directory_Name, Is_Parent_Directory_Name, or Is_Current_Directory_Name are True.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>In particular, the default directory is not used to find the containing directory either when Is_Parent_Directory_Name or Is_Current_Directory_Name is True. As noted above, these functions operate purely on the syntax of the file names and do not attempt to interpret them. If interpretation is needed, Directories.Full_Name can be to expand any shorthands used before calling Containing_Directory. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 2005

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0049-1"}</em>{"}"} Package Ada.Directories.Hierarchical_File_Names is new. </p></Admonition>


## A.16.2  The Packages Wide_Directories and Wide_Wide_Directories

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0021-1"}</em>{"}"} The packages Wide_Directories and Wide_Wide_Directories provide operations for manipulating files and directories, and their names. </p>

#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0021-1"}</em>{"}"} The specification of package Wide_Directories is the same as for Directories (including its optional child packages Information and Hierarchical_File_Names), except that each occurrence of String is replaced by Wide_String. </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0021-1"}</em>{"}"} The specification of package Wide_Wide_Directories is the same as for Directories (including its optional child packages Information and Hierarchical_File_Names), except that each occurrence of String is replaced by Wide_Wide_String. </p>

#### Extensions to Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0021-1"}</em>{"}"} These six packages are new. </p></Admonition>
