<p>A <em>stream</em> is a sequence of elements comprising values from possibly different types and allowing sequential access to these values. A <em>stream type</em> is a type in the class whose root type is Streams.Root_Stream_Type. A stream type may be implemented in various ways, such as an external sequential file, an internal buffer, or a network channel. </p>

## 13.13.1  The Streams Subsystem


#### Static Semantics

<p>The abstract type Root_Stream_Type is the root type of the class of stream types. The types in this class represent different kinds of streams. A new stream type is defined by extending the root type (or some other stream type), overriding the Read and Write operations, and optionally defining additional primitive subprograms, according to the requirements of the particular kind of stream. The predefined stream-oriented attributes like T'Read and T'Write make dispatching calls on the Read and Write procedures of the Root_Stream_Type. (User-defined T'Read and T'Write attributes can also make such calls, or can call the Read and Write attributes of other types.)</p>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Reason: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0241-1"}</em>{"}"} This package must allow blocking (Nonblocking ={">"} False) for compatibility. The purpose of this package is to provide a template for overriding user-defined routines; and such routines can only allow blocking if the root type does so. Users can still declare their overridding routines nonblocking if they wish. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00227-01"}</em>{"}"} The Read operation transfers stream elements from the specified stream to fill the array Item. Elements are transferred until Item'Length elements have been transferred, or until the end of the stream is reached. If any elements are transferred, the index of the last stream element transferred is returned in Last. Otherwise, Item'First - 1 is returned in Last. Last is less than Item'Last only if the end of the stream is reached.</p>
<p>The Write operation appends Item to the specified stream.</p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00114-01"}</em>{"}"} The index subtype of Stream_Element_Array is Stream_Element_Offset because we wish to allow maximum flexibility. Most Stream_Element_Arrays will probably have a lower bound of 0 or 1, but other lower bounds, including negative ones, make sense in some situations.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00114-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} Note that there are some language-defined subprograms that fill part of a Stream_Element_Array, and return the index of the last element filled as a Stream_Element_Offset. The Read procedures declared here, Streams.Stream_IO (see A.12.1), and System.RPC (see E.5) behave in this manner. These will raise Constraint_Error if the resulting Last value is not in Stream_Element_Offset. This implies that the Stream_Element_Array passed to these subprograms should not have a lower bound of Stream_Element_Offset'First, because then a read of 0 elements would always raise Constraint_Error. A better choice of lower bound is 0 or 1. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0293-1"}</em>{"}"} Three additional packages provide stream implementations that do not make use of any file operations. These packages provide the same operations, with Streams.Storage providing an abstract interface, and two child packages providing implementations of that interface.

## 13.13.2  Stream-Oriented Attributes

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0183-1"}</em>{"}"} The type-related operational attributes Write, Read, Output, and Input convert values to a stream of elements and reconstruct values from a stream. </p>

#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00270-01"}</em>{"}"} For every subtype S of an elementary type <em>T</em>, the following representation attribute is defined: </p>
<p>S'Stream_Size{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00270-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0194-1"}</em>{"}"} Denotes the number of bits read from or written to a stream by the default implementations of S'Read and S'Write. Hence, the number of stream elements required per item of elementary type <em>T</em> is:</p>
<CodeBlock>
T'Stream_Size / Ada.Streams.Stream_Element'Size{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>The value of this attribute is of type <em>universal_integer</em> and is a multiple of Stream_Element'Size.</p>
<p>Stream_Size may be specified for first subtypes via an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code>; the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> of such a clause shall be static, nonnegative, and a multiple of Stream_Element'Size.</p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Aspect Description for </strong><strong>Stream_Size: </strong>Size in bits used to represent elementary objects in a stream.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>Stream_Size is a type-related attribute (see 13.1). </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0194-1"}</em>{"}"} The value of S'Stream_Size is unaffected by the presence or absence of any <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code>s or <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code>s specifying the Read or Write attributes of any ancestor of S. S'Stream_Size is defined in terms of the behavior of the default implementations of S'Read and S'Write even if those default implementations are overridden. </p></Admonition>


#### Implementation Advice

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00270-01"}</em>{"}"} If not specified, the value of Stream_Size for an elementary type should be the number of bits that corresponds to the minimum number of stream elements required by the first subtype of the type, rounded up to the nearest factor or multiple of the word size that is also a multiple of the stream element size. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Implementation Advice: </strong>If not specified, the value of Stream_Size for an elementary type should be the number of bits that corresponds to the minimum number of stream elements required by the first subtype of the type, rounded up to the nearest factor or multiple of the word size that is also a multiple of the stream element size.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Reason: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00270-01"}</em>{"}"} This is Implementation Advice because we want to allow implementations to remain compatible with their Ada 95 implementations, which may have a different handling of the number of stream elements. Users can always specify Stream_Size if they need a specific number of stream elements. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00270-01"}</em>{"}"} The recommended level of support for the Stream_Size attribute is: </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00270-01"}</em>{"}"} A Stream_Size clause should be supported for a discrete or fixed point type <em>T</em> if the specified Stream_Size is a multiple of Stream_Element'Size and is no less than the size of the first subtype of <em>T</em>, and no greater than the size of the largest type of the same elementary class (signed integer, modular integer, enumeration, ordinary fixed point, or decimal fixed point). </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Implementation Advice: </strong>The recommended level of support for the Stream_Size attribute should be followed.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>There are no requirements beyond supporting confirming Stream_Size clauses for floating point and access types. Floating point and access types usually only have a handful of defined formats, streaming anything else makes no sense for them.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>For discrete and fixed point types, this may require support for sizes other than the "natural" ones. For instance, on a typical machine with 32-bit integers and a Stream_Element'Size of 8, setting Stream_Size to 24 must be supported. This is required as such formats can be useful for interoperability with unusual machines, and there is no difficulty with the implementation (drop extra bits on output, sign extend on input). </p></Admonition>


#### Static Semantics

<p>For every subtype S of a specific type <em>T</em>, the following attributes are defined. </p>
<p>S'WriteS'Write denotes a procedure with the following specification: </p>
<CodeBlock>
{"{"}{"AI95-00441-01"}{"}"} procedure S'Write({"\n"}   Stream : not null access Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class;{"\n"}   Item : in T){"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>S'Write writes the value of <em>Item</em> to <em>Stream</em>.</p>
<p>S'ReadS'Read denotes a procedure with the following specification: </p>
<CodeBlock>
{"{"}{"AI95-00441-01"}{"}"} procedure S'Read({"\n"}   Stream : not null access Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class;{"\n"}   Item : out T){"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>S'Read reads the value of <em>Item</em> from <em>Stream</em>. </p>
<p><em>This paragraph was deleted.</em>{"{"}<em>8652/0040</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00108-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00444-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0192-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0419-1"}</em>{"}"} </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00444-01"}</em>{"}"} The default implementations of the Write and Read attributes, where available, execute as follows:</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0040</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00108-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00195-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00251-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00270-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0139-2"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0191-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0419-1"}</em>{"}"} For nonderived elementary types, Read reads (and Write writes) the number of stream elements implied by the Stream_Size for the type <em>T</em>; the representation of those stream elements is implementation defined. For nonderived composite types, the Write or Read attribute for each component (excluding those, if any, that are not components of the nominal type of the object) is called in canonical order, which is last dimension varying fastest for an array (unless the convention of the array is Fortran, in which case it is first dimension varying fastest), and positional aggregate order for a record. Bounds are not included in the stream if <em>T</em> is an array type. If <em>T</em> is a discriminated type, discriminants are included only if they have defaults. If <em>T</em> is a tagged type, the tag is not included. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Implementation defined: </strong>The contents of the stream elements read and written by the Read and Write attributes of elementary types.</p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0419-1"}</em>{"}"} For type extensions, the Write or Read attribute for the parent type is called, followed by the Write or Read attribute of each component of the extension part, in canonical order. For a limited type extension, if the attribute of the parent type or any progenitor type of <em>T</em> is available anywhere within the immediate scope of <em>T</em>, and the attribute of the parent type or the type of any of the extension components is not available at the freezing point of <em>T</em>, then the attribute of <em>T</em> shall be directly specified. For untagged derived types, the Write (resp. Read) attribute invokes the corresponding attribute of the parent type, if the attribute is available for the parent type.</p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Implementation Note: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0419-1"}</em>{"}"} The default implementation of a stream-oriented attribute might not be well-defined in cases where the attribute is never available anywhere in the scope of the type. In such cases, the attribute cannot be called and is defined (far below) to raise Program_Error. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0023-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0264-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0419-1"}</em>{"}"} If <em>T</em> is a discriminated type and its discriminants have defaults, then S'Read first reads the discriminants from the stream without modifying <em>Item</em>. S'Read then creates an object of type <em>T</em> constrained by these discriminants. The value of this object is then converted to the subtype of <em>Item</em> and is assigned to <em>Item</em>. Finally, the Read attribute for each nondiscriminant component of <em>Item</em> is called in canonical order as described above. Normal default initialization and finalization take place for the created object.</p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Reason: </strong>A discriminant with a default value is treated simply as a component of the object. On the other hand, an array bound or a discriminant without a default value, is treated as "descriptor" or "dope" that must be provided in order to create the object and thus is logically separate from the regular components. Such "descriptor" data are written by 'Output and produced as part of the delivered result by the 'Input function, but they are not written by 'Write nor read by 'Read. A tag is like a discriminant without a default.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0040</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00108-01"}</em>{"}"} For limited type extensions, we must have a definition of 'Read and 'Write if the parent type has one, as it is possible to make a dispatching call through the attributes. The rule is designed to automatically do the right thing in as many cases as possible.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00251-01"}</em>{"}"} Similarly, a type that has a progenitor with an available attribute must also have that attribute, for the same reason.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0023-1"}</em>{"}"} The semantics of S'Read for a discriminated type with defaults involves an anonymous object so that the point of required initialization and finalization is well-defined, especially for objects that change shape and have controlled components. The creation of this anonymous object often can be omitted (see the Implementation Permissions below). </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">

For each component that is of an access type, if the implementation can detect that the value returned by Read for the component is not a value of its subtype, Constraint_Error is raised.

<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00251-01"}</em>{"}"} Stream attributes (other than Input) are always null procedures for interface types (they have no components). We need to allow explicit setting of the Read and Write attributes in order that the class-wide attributes like LI'Class'Input can be made available. (In that case, any descendant of the interface type would require available attributes.) But we don't allow any concrete implementation because these don't participate in extensions (unless the interface is the parent type). If we didn't ban concrete implementations, the order of declaration of a pair of interfaces would become significant. For example, if Int1 and Int2 are interfaces with concrete implementations of 'Read, then the following declarations would have different implementations for 'Read: </p></Admonition>

type Con1 is new Int1 and Int2 with null record;{"\n"}type Con2 is new Int2 and Int1 with null record;{"\n"}

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>The Input attribute cannot be specified for an interface. As it is a function, a null procedure is impossible; a concrete function is not possible anyway as any function returning an abstract type must be abstract. And we don't allow specifying stream attributes to be abstract subprograms. This has no impact, as the availability of Int'Class'Input (where Int is a limited interface) depends on whether Int'Read (not Int'Input) is specified. There is no reason to allow Int'Output to be specified, either, but there is equally no reason to disallow it, so we don't have a special rule for that. </p></Admonition>

#### Erroneous Execution

<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>The definition of Descendant_Tag prevents such a tag from being provided to T'Class'Input if T is a library-level type. However, this rule is needed for nested tagged types. </p></Admonition>


#### Implementation Requirements

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0040</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00108-01"}</em>{"}"} For every subtype <em>S</em> of a language-defined nonlimited specific type <em>T</em>, the output generated by S'Output or S'Write shall be readable by S'Input or S'Read, respectively.

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00195-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0092-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0445-1"}</em>{"}"} The number of calls performed by the predefined implementation of the stream-oriented attributes on the Read and Write operations of the stream type is unspecified. An implementation may take advantage of this permission to perform internal buffering. However, all the calls on the Read and Write operations of the stream type used to implement an explicit invocation of a stream-oriented attribute shall take place before this invocation returns. An explicit invocation is one appearing explicitly in the program text, possibly through a generic instantiation (see 12.3).</p>

If they are not equal and <em>Item</em> is a constrained variable, then Constraint_Error may be raised at that point, before any further values are read from the stream and before the object of type <em>T</em> is created.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0023-1"}</em>{"}"} A default implementation of S'Input that calls the default implementation of S'Read may create a constrained anonymous object with discriminants that match those in the stream. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Implementation Note: </strong>This allows the combined executions of S'Input and S'Read to create one object of type <em>T</em> instead of two. If this option is exercised, then: </p></Admonition>

<p>The discriminants are read from the stream by S'Input, not S'Read.</p>
<p>S'Input declares an object of type <em>T</em> constrained by the discriminants read from the stream, not an unconstrained object.</p>

#### Inconsistencies With Ada 95

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0040</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00108-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Clarified how the default implementation for stream attributes is determined (eliminating conflicting language). The new wording provides that attributes for type extensions are created by composing the parent's attribute with those for the extension components if any. If a program was written assuming that the extension components were not included in the stream (as in original Ada 95), it would fail to work in the language as corrected by the Corrigendum.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00195-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Amendment Correction:</strong> Explicitly provided a permission that the number of calls to the underlying stream Read and Write operations may differ from the number determined by the canonical operations. If Ada 95 code somehow depended on the number of calls to Read or Write, it could fail with an Ada 2005 implementation. Such code is likely to be very rare; moreover, such code is really wrong, as the permission applies to Ada 95 as well. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 95

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00270-01"}</em>{"}"} The Stream_Size attribute is new. It allows specifying the number of bits that will be streamed for a type. The Implementation Advice involving this also was changed; this is not incompatible because Implementation Advice does not have to be followed.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0040</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00108-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00195-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00444-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Limited types may have default constructed attributes if all of the parent and (for extensions) extension components have available attributes. Ada 2005 adds the notion of availability to patch up some holes in the Corrigendum model. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Added wording to specify that these are operational attributes.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0045</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00132-01"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Clarified that End_Error is raised by the default implementation of Read and Input if the end of the stream is reached. (The result could have been abnormal without this clarification, thus this is not an inconsistency, as the programmer could not have depended on the previous behavior.)</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00195-01"}</em>{"}"} Clarified that the default implementation of S'Input does normal initialization on the object that it passes to S'Read.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00195-01"}</em>{"}"} Explicitly stated that what is read from a stream when a required check fails is unspecified.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00251-01"}</em>{"}"} Defined availability and default implementations for types with progenitors.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00279-01"}</em>{"}"} Specified that Constraint_Error is raised if the internal tag retrieved for S'Class'Input is for some type not covered by S'Class or is abstract. We also explicitly state that the program is erroneous if the tag has not been created or does not currently exist in the partition. (Ada 95 did not specify what happened in these cases; it's very unlikely to have provided some useful result, so this is not considered an inconsistency.)</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00344-01"}</em>{"}"} Added wording to support nested type extensions. S'Input and S'Output always raise Tag_Error for such extensions, and such extensions were not permitted in Ada 95, so this is neither an extension nor an incompatibility.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00366-01"}</em>{"}"} Defined <em>supports external streaming</em> to put all of the rules about "good" stream attributes in one place. This is used for distribution and for defining pragma Pure.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00441-01"}</em>{"}"} Added the <strong>not null</strong> qualifier to the first parameter of all of the stream attributes, so that the semantics doesn't change between Ada 95 and Ada 2005. This change is compatible, because mode conformance is required for subprograms specified as stream attributes, and <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.10#S0083">null_exclusion</a></code>s are not considered for mode conformance.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00444-01"}</em>{"}"} Improved the wording to make it clear that we don't define the default implementations of attributes that cannot be called (that is, aren't "available"). Also clarified when inheritance takes place. </p></Admonition>


#### Incompatibilities With Ada 2005

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0039-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Added a requirement that stream attributes be specified by a static subprogram name rather than a dynamic expression. Expressions cannot provide any useful functionality because of the freezing rules, and the possibility of them complicates implementations. Only pathological programs should be affected. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 2005

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0007-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Stream attributes for scalar types can be specified with subprograms that take the first subtype as well as the base type. This eliminates confusion about which subtype is appropriate for attributes specified for partial views whose full type is a scalar type. It also eliminates a common user error (forgetting 'Base). </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2005

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0023-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Corrected the definition of the default version S'Read and S'Input to be well-defined if S is a discriminated type with defaulted discriminants and some components require initialization and/or finalizations.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0065-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Defined remote access types to support external streaming, since that is their purpose.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0109-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Removed a misleading phrase which implies that Constraint_Error is raised for internal tags of the wrong type, when Tag_Error should be raised for such tags.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0139-2"}</em>{"}"} Clarified that arrays with convention Fortran are written in column-major order, rather then row-major order. This is necessary in order that streaming of Fortran arrays is efficient.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0192-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Clarified that the profile of an inherited stream attribute is as defined for an inherited primitive subprogram, while the default implementation of the same attribute might have a different profile.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0194-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Correction:</strong> Clarified that Stream_Size has no effect on and is not effected by user-defined stream attributes. </p></Admonition>


#### Inconsistencies With Ada 2012

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0419-1"}</em>{"}"} The switch from inheritance to "implicitly composed" aspects means that there exists an exceedingly unlikely case where Ada 2022 code will raise Constraint_Error where Ada 2012 code would not. That case requires deriving a constrained untagged composite type <em>C</em> from an unconstrained parent type <em>P</em>, using a type conversion to <em>P</em> of the Input attribute of <em>C</em>, <strong>and</strong> streaming in a value that violates the constraints of <em>C</em>. Simply using the Input attribute of <em>P</em> instead of that of <em>C</em> will restore the Ada 2012 behavior. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 2012

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0106-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Defined how to specify a class-wide stream-oriented attribute using an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code>. It was always intended that this was possible, but the method was not clear, as a class-wide type never has an explicit declaration. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2012

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0030-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Defined the runtime effect of stream attributes for untagged limited types, as there is a weird corner case where they can be called. We don't specify this as an inconsistency, as it doesn't make semantic sense to stream a task, and nothing useful could have been done with that, so it should not exist in any programs.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0106-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong>Corrigendum:</strong> Clarified that the same Legality Rules apply when a stream-oriented attribute is specified via an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> as applied when it is specified via an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code>.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0064-2"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0396-1"}</em>{"}"} Added the definition of Nonblocking (see 9.5) and Global (see 6.1.2) for stream-oriented attributes.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0419-1"}</em>{"}"} Revised to define composition of stream-oriented attributes for untagged derived types in order to avoid using inheritance for these attributes/aspects. </p></Admonition>
