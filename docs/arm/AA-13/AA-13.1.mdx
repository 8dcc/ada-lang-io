<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>An operational aspect is an aspect that indicates a logical property of an entity, such as the precondition of a subprogram, or the procedure used to write a given type of object to a stream.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A representation aspect is an aspect that indicates how an entity is mapped onto the underlying hardware, for example the size or alignment of an object.<br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0183-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0295-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />[Either kind of aspect of an entity may be specified by means of an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> (see 13.1.1), which is an optional element of most kinds of declarations and applies to the entity or entities being declared. Aspects may also be specified by certain other constructs occurring subsequent to the declaration of the affected entity: a representation aspect value may be specified by means of a representation item and an operational aspect value may be specified by means of an operational item.]<br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />There are six kinds of <em>representation items</em>: <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code>s for representation attributes, <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.4#S0350">enumeration_representation_clause</a></code>s, <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.5#S0352">record_representation_clause</a></code>s, <code><a href="../AA-J/AA-J.7#S0368">at_clause</a></code>s, <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.5#S0353">component_clause</a></code>s, and <em>representation pragmas</em>. [ They can be provided to give more efficient representation or to interface with features that are outside the domain of the language (for example, peripheral hardware). ]<br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />An <em>operational item</em> is an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code> for an operational attribute.<br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />[An operational item or a representation item applies to an entity identified by a <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code>, which denotes an entity declared local to the current declarative region, or a library unit declared immediately preceding a representation pragma in a <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0285">compilation</a></code>.] <br /></p>


#### Language Design Principles

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0295-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Representation aspects are intended to refer to properties that need to be known before the compiler can generate code to create or access an entity. For instance, the size of an object needs to be known before the object can be created. Conversely, operational aspects are those that only need to be known before they can be used. For instance, how an object is read from a stream only needs to be known when a stream read is executed. Thus, representation aspects have stricter rules as to when they can be specified.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00291-02"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0295-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Confirming the value of an aspect should never change the semantics of the aspect. Thus Size = 8 (for example) means the same thing whether it was specified with a representation item or whether the compiler chose this value by default. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>An aspect is a specifiable property of an entity. An aspect may be specified by an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> on the declaration of the entity. Some aspects may be queried via attributes.<br /></Admonition>


#### Syntax

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br /><code>aspect_clause</code><a id="S0343"></a><a id="S0344"></a><code> ::= </code><code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code><br />      | <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.4#S0350">enumeration_representation_clause</a></code><br />      | <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.5#S0352">record_representation_clause</a></code><br />      | <code><a href="../AA-J/AA-J.7#S0368">at_clause</a></code><br /></p>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />A representation pragma is allowed only at places where an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0343">aspect_clause</a></code> or <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0286">compilation_unit</a></code> is allowed. <br /></p>


#### Name Resolution Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />In an operational item or representation item, if the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code> is a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0092">direct_name</a></code>, then it shall resolve to denote a declaration (or, in the case of a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code>, one or more declarations) that occurs immediately within the same declarative region as the item. If the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code> has an <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0101">attribute_designator</a></code>, then it shall resolve to denote an implementation-defined component (see 13.5.1) or a class-wide type implicitly declared immediately within the same declarative region as the item. A <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code> that is a <em>library_unit_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> (only permitted in a representation pragma) shall resolve to denote the <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0287">library_item</a></code> that immediately precedes (except for other pragmas) the representation pragma. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />This is a Name Resolution Rule, because we don't want an operational or representation item for X to be ambiguous just because there's another X declared in an outer declarative region. It doesn't make much difference, since most operational or representation items are for types or subtypes, and type and subtype names can't be overloaded. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The visibility rules imply that the declaration has to occur before the operational or representation item.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />For objects, this implies that operational or representation items can be applied only to stand-alone objects. <br /></Admonition>


#### Legality Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0009</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00137-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />The <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code> of an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0343">aspect_clause</a></code> or representation pragma shall statically denote an entity (or, in the case of a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code>, one or more entities) declared immediately preceding it in a <code><a href="../AA-10/AA-10.1#S0285">compilation</a></code>, or within the same <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-7/AA-7.1#S0230">package_specification</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.1#S0246">task_definition</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.4#S0251">protected_definition</a></code>, or <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.8#S0067">record_definition</a></code> as the representation or operational item. If a <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code> denotes a [local] callable entity, it may do so through a [local] <code><a href="../AA-8/AA-8.5#S0242">subprogram_renaming_declaration</a></code> [(as a way to resolve ambiguity in the presence of overloading)]; otherwise, the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code> shall not denote a <code><a href="../AA-8/AA-8.5#S0238">renaming_declaration</a></code>. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>The "statically denote" part implies that it is impossible to specify the representation of an object that is not a stand-alone object, except in the case of a representation item like pragma Atomic that is allowed inside a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.8#S0068">component_list</a></code> (in which case the representation item specifies the representation of components of all objects of the type). It also prevents the problem of renamings of things like "P.<strong>all</strong>" (where P is an access-to-subprogram value) or "E(I)" (where E is an entry family).<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The part about where the denoted entity has to have been declared appears twice - once as a Name Resolution Rule, and once as a Legality Rule. Suppose P renames Q, and we have a representation item in a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code> whose <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code> is P. The fact that the representation item has to appear in the same <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code> as P is a Name Resolution Rule, whereas the fact that the representation item has to appear in the same <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.11#S0086">declarative_part</a></code> as Q is a Legality Rule. This is subtle, but it seems like the least confusing set of rules. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>A separate Legality Rule applies for <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.5#S0353">component_clause</a></code>s. See 13.5.1, "Record Representation Clauses". <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00291-02"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0445-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The <em>representation</em> of an object consists of a certain number of bits (the <em>size</em> of the object). For an object of an elementary type, these are the bits that are normally read or updated by the machine code when loading, storing, or operating-on the value of the object. For an object of a composite type, these are the bits reserved for this object, and include bits occupied by subcomponents of the object. If the size of an object is greater than that of its subtype, the additional bits are padding bits. For an elementary object, these padding bits are normally read and updated along with the others. For a composite object, it is unspecified whether padding bits are read or updated in any given composite operation.<br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00291-02"}</em>{"}"} <br />Discontiguous representations are allowed, but the ones we're interested in here are generally contiguous sequences of bits. For a discontiguous representation, the size doesn't necessarily describe the "footprint" of the object in memory (that is, the amount of space taken in the address space for the object). <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00291-02"}</em>{"}"} <br />In the case of composite objects, we want the implementation to have the flexibility to either do operations component-by-component, or with a block operation covering all of the bits. We carefully avoid giving a preference in the wording. There is no requirement for the choice to be documented, either, as the implementation can make that choice based on many factors, and could make a different choice for different operations on the same object.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00291-02"}</em>{"}"} <br />In the case of a properly aligned, contiguous object whose size is a multiple of the storage unit size, no other bits should be read or updated as part of operating on the object. We don't say this normatively because it would be difficult to normatively define "properly aligned" or "contiguous". <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>Two objects with the same value do not necessarily have the same representation. For example, an implementation might represent False as zero and True as any odd value. Similarly, two objects (of the same type) with the same sequence of bits do not necessarily have the same value. For example, an implementation might use a biased representation in some cases but not others: <br /></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
--  {"{"}{"AI05-0229-1"}{"}"}{"\n"} subtype S is Integer range 1..256;{"\n"}type A is array(Natural range 1..4) of S{"\n"}   with Pack;{"\n"}X : S := 3;{"\n"}Y : A := (1, 2, 3, 4);{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The implementation might use a biased-by-1 representation for the array elements, but not for X. X and Y(3) have the same value, but different representation: the representation of X is a sequence of (say) 32 bits: 0...011, whereas the representation of Y(3) is a sequence of 8 bits: 00000010 (assuming a two's complement representation).<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Such tricks are not required, but are allowed. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>The value of any padding bits is not specified by the language, though for a numeric type, it will be much harder to properly implement the predefined operations if the padding bits are not either all zero, or a sign extension. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />For example, suppose S'Size = 2, and an object X is of subtype S. If the machine code typically uses a 32-bit load instruction to load the value of X, then X'Size should be 32, even though 30 bits of the value are just zeros or sign-extension bits. On the other hand, if the machine code typically masks out those 30 bits, then X'Size should be 2. Usually, such masking only happens for components of a composite type for which Pack, Component_Size, or record layout is specified.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Note, however, that the formal parameter of an instance of Unchecked_Conversion is a special case. Its Size is required to be the same as that of its subtype.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
Note that we don't generally talk about the representation of a value. A value is considered to be an amorphous blob without any particular representation. An object is considered to be more concrete. <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0112-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0295-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0396-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0407-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />A representation item <em>directly specifies</em> a <em>representation aspect</em> of the entity denoted by the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code>, except in the case of a type-related representation item, whose <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0345">local_name</a></code> shall denote a first subtype, and which directly specifies an aspect of the subtype's type. A representation item that names a subtype is either <em>subtype-specific</em> (Size, Object_Size, and Alignment clauses) or <em>type-related</em> (all others).<br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<em>This paragraph was deleted.</em>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0407-1"}</em>{"}"} <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>Some representation items directly specify more than one aspect. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />For example, a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> Export (see J.15.5) specifies the convention of an entity, and also specifies that it is exported. Such items are obsolescent; directly specifying the associated aspects is preferred. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>Each specifiable attribute constitutes a separate aspect. An <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.4#S0350">enumeration_representation_clause</a></code> specifies the coding aspect. A <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.5#S0352">record_representation_clause</a></code> (without the <code><a href="../AA-J/AA-J.8#S0369">mod_clause</a></code>) specifies the record layout aspect. Each representation pragma specifies a separate aspect. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>We don't need to say that an <code><a href="../AA-J/AA-J.7#S0368">at_clause</a></code> or a <code><a href="../AA-J/AA-J.8#S0369">mod_clause</a></code> specify separate aspects, because these are equivalent to <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.3#S0349">attribute_definition_clause</a></code>s. See J.7, "At Clauses", and J.8, "Mod Clauses".<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0112-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />We give a default naming for representation aspects of representation pragmas so we don't have to do that for every pragma. Operational and representation attributes are given a default naming in 13.3. We don't want any anonymous aspects; that would make other rules more difficult to write and understand. <br /></Admonition>

This rule is not needed for tagged types, because other rules prevent a type-related representation aspect from changing the representation of the parent part; we want to allow specifying a type-related representation aspect on a type extension to specify aspects of the extension part.

For instance, the default implementation of a stream-oriented attribute cannot be confirmed, as any subprogram that can be specified is not the same as the default subprogram, and thus is nonconfirming. Whether the effect is the same is not relevant for this purpose; it would be very difficult to formally define what it means to have the same effect. (Note that one can name any implementation for a stream-oriented attribute by using the associated attribute but specifying that by name would violate the circular aspect definition rule.) This is true for any implicitly composed aspect. Similarly, aspect Default_Value cannot be confirmed as the default is that there is no default value; any value that can be specified is not that. <br /></Admonition>

#### Implementation Advice

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0295-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The recommended level of support for the specification of all representation aspects is qualified as follows: <br /></p>

<ul>
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00291-02"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0295-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />A confirming specification for a representation aspect should be supported. <br /></li>
</ul>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<strong>To be honest: </strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0295-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />A confirming representation aspect value might not be possible for some entities. For instance, consider an unconstrained array. The size of such a type is implementation-defined, and might not actually be a representable value, or might not be static. <br /></Admonition>

<ul>
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0295-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0444-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />An implementation is not required to support the specification for a representation aspect that contains nonstatic expressions, unless each nonstatic expression is a <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code> that statically denotes a constant declared before the entity. <br /></li>
</ul>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>This is to avoid the following sort of thing: <br /></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
--  {"{"}{"AI12-0005-1"}{"}"}{"\n"} X : Integer := F(...){"\n"}   with Address ={">"} Y;{"\n"}Y : Address := G(...);{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
In the above, we have to evaluate the initialization expression for X before we know where to put the result. This seems like an unreasonable implementation burden.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The above code should instead be written like this: <br /></Admonition>

<CodeBlock>
--  {"{"}{"AI12-0005-1"}{"}"}{"\n"} Y : constant Address := G(...);{"\n"}X : Integer := F(...){"\n"}   with Address ={">"} Y;{"\n"}

</CodeBlock>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
This allows the expression "Y" to be safely evaluated before X is created.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
The constant could be a formal parameter of mode <strong>in</strong>.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
An implementation can support other nonstatic expressions if it wants to. Expressions of type Address are hardly ever static, but their value might be known at compile time anyway in many cases. <br /></Admonition>

<ul>
<li>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0059-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0444-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />An implementation is not required to support a specification for the Object_Size or Size for a given composite subtype, nor the size or storage place for an object (including a component) of a given composite subtype, unless the constraints on the subtype and its composite subcomponents (if any) are all static constraints.<br /></li>
</ul>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0059-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />We don't want to require that Object_Size or Size be supported on types that might have a representation not completely specified at compile time, or are represented discontiguously, or are represented differently for different constraints. <br /></Admonition>

</ul>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>The intent is that access types, type System.Address, and the pointer used for a by-reference parameter should be implementable as a single machine address - bit-field pointers should not be required.

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-note" title="Implementation Note: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00291-02"}</em>{"}"} <br />We want subprograms to be able to assume the properties of the types of their parameters inside of subprograms. While many objects can be copied to allow this (and thus do not need limitations), aliased or by-reference objects cannot be copied (their memory location is part of their identity). Thus, the above rule does not apply to types that merely allow by-reference parameter passing; for such types, a copy typically needs to be made at the call site when a bit-aligned component is passed as a parameter. <br /></Admonition>

<ul>

</ul>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">

</ul>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>Unlike elementary objects, there is no requirement that all bits of a composite object participate in operations. Thus, as long as the object is the same or larger in size than that expected by the access type, all is well. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<strong></strong>This rule presumes that the implementation allocates an object of a size specified to be larger than the default size in such a way that access of the default size suffices to correctly read and write the value of the object. <br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
It is now illegal for a representation item to cause a derived by-reference type to have a different record layout from its parent. This is necessary for by-reference parameter passing to be feasible. This only affects programs that specify the representation of types derived from types containing tasks; most by-reference types are new to Ada 95. For example, if A1 is an array of tasks, and A2 is derived from A1, it is illegal to apply a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> Pack to A2. <br /></Admonition>

There are two references to "type representation clause" in RM83, both in Section 13; these have been reworded.

#### Incompatibilities With Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0109-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br />Corrigendum:</strong> Added a rule that makes it illegal to specify a representation value after a type is derived from an untagged by-reference type. This restriction is incompatible, but since the implementation would have had to copy an object that does not allow copying in order to change the representation for any implicit or explicit conversion between the original and the derived type, it is unlikely that any program could exist without running into internal compiler errors or bogus results.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0181-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Added a rule preventing self-referencing representation or operational aspects. This is technically incompatible, but since the similar representation or operational item has been illegal since they've existed, and they don't make any sense, it's unlikely that any implementation accepted them or that they appear in any program.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0222-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Added a rule preventing giving a representation aspect on a partial view. Since this has always been prohibited for other kinds of representation items, it's unlikely that any implementation accepted them or that they appear in any program. <br /></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0376-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />It is now allowed to specify type-related representation aspects for an untagged derived type that has primitive operations, so long as the type is not a by-reference type. <br /></Admonition>

{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0267-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Syntactically, <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code>s generally are located at the end of declarations. When a declaration is all in one piece such as a <code><a href="../AA-6/AA-6.7#S0227">null_procedure_declaration</a></code>, <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.3#S0032">object_declaration</a></code>, or <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0315">generic_instantiation</a></code> the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> goes at the end of the declaration; it is then more visible and less likely to interfere with the layout of the rest of the structure. However, we make an exception for program units (other than subprogram specifications) and bodies, in which the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> goes before the <strong>is</strong>. In these cases, the entity could be large and could contain other declarations that also have <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code>s, so it is better to put the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> toward the top of the declaration. (Some aspects  such as Pure  also affect the legality of the contents of a unit, so it would be annoying to only see those after reading the entire unit.)<br /></Admonition>

<strong></strong>Most language-defined aspects (for example, preconditions) are intended to be available to callers, and specifying them on a body that has a separate declaration hides them from callers. Specific language-defined aspects may allow this, but they have to do so explicitly (by defining an alternative Legality Rule), and provide any needed rules about visibility. Note that this rule does not apply to implementation-defined aspects, so implementers need to carefully define whether such aspects can be applied to bodies and stubs, and what happens if they are specified on both the declaration and body of a unit. <br /></Admonition>

This was an oversight in {"AI12-0169-1"} <br />which allowed <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code>s on an <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.5#S0260">entry_body</a></code> in the first place.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0206-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Extended the definition of nonoverridable aspects to cover most kinds of aspects.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0211-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Added a rule so that the a nonoverridable aspect has to be the same for every ancestor of a type.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0355-2"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0427-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Clarified when elaboration and resolution of <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code>s not associated with a declaration occur.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0380-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0407-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Revised the rules about entities that cannot have specified language-defined aspects. The body portion of the rule was changed to a general prohibition on specifying language-defined aspects on completions (this allows specifying aspects on bodies that act as a declaration, and eliminates the list of entities, which was a maintenance nightmare). Then the remaining entities (renamings and generic formal parameters) were revised to allow specific aspects, since Nonblocking (see 9.5), as well as Pre and Post, are now allowed on generic formal parameters.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0373-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Added the missing definition for resolution of entities found in aspects of library units.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0396-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong><br /></strong> Defined confirming for nonoverridable aspects that are <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code>s or <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.3#S0106">aggregate</a></code>s.<br /></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0419-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Added a description of additive and implicitly composed aspects in order to explain the different inheritance mechanisms used by existing aspects. <br /></Admonition>
