18.a
</MarginText>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>Only one exception is defined in System.RPC, although many sources of errors might exist. This is so because it is not always possible to distinguish among these errors. In particular, it is often impossible to tell the difference between a failing communication link and a failing processing node.

<p>The procedure System.RPC.Establish_RPC_Receiver is called once, immediately after elaborating the library units of an active partition (that is, right after the <em>elaboration of the partition</em>) if the partition includes an RCI library unit, but prior to invoking the main subprogram, if any. The Partition parameter is the Partition_Id of the active partition being elaborated. The Receiver parameter designates an implementation-provided procedure called the <em>RPC-receiver</em> which will handle all RPCs received by the partition from the PCS. Establish_RPC_Receiver saves a reference to the RPC-receiver; when a message is received at the called partition, the RPC-receiver is called with the Params stream containing the message. When the RPC-receiver returns, the contents of the stream designated by Result is placed in a message and sent back to the calling partition. <br /></p>

#### Implementation Requirements

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>
24
</MarginText>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<p>The implementation of the RPC-receiver shall be reentrant[, thereby allowing concurrent calls on it from the PCS to service concurrent remote subprogram calls into the partition]. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>
24.a
</MarginText>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>There seems no reason to allow the implementation of RPC-receiver to be nonreentrant, even though we don't require that every implementation of the PCS actually perform concurrent calls on the RPC-receiver. <br /></Admonition>

</MarginText>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0087</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00082-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />An implementation shall not restrict the replacement of the body of System.RPC. An implementation shall not restrict children of System.RPC. [The related implementation permissions in the introduction to Annex A do not apply.] <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>
24.a.1/1
</MarginText>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>The point of System.RPC is to let the user tailor the communications mechanism without requiring changes to or other cooperation from the compiler. However, implementations can restrict the replacement of language-defined units. This requirement overrides that permission for System.RPC. <br /></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>8652/0087</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00082-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />If the implementation of System.RPC is provided by the user, an implementation shall support remote subprogram calls as specified. <br /></p>

<AnnotatedOnly>

24.b/2
</MarginText>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00273-01"}</em>{"}"} <br />If the implementation takes advantage of the implementation permission to use a different specification for System.RPC, it still needs to use it for remote subprogram calls, and allow the user to replace the body of System.RPC. It just isn't guaranteed to be portable to do so in Ada 2005 - an advantage which was more theoretical than real anyway. <br /></Admonition>


#### Documentation Requirements

<AnnotatedOnly>
<MarginText>
25
</MarginText>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<p>The implementation of the PCS shall document whether the RPC-receiver is invoked from concurrent tasks. If there is an upper limit on the number of such tasks, this limit shall be documented as well, together with the mechanisms to configure it (if this is supported). <br /></p>

<p>The PCS is allowed to contain implementation-defined interfaces for explicit message passing, broadcasting, etc. Similarly, it is allowed to provide additional interfaces to query the state of some remote partition (given its partition ID) or of the PCS itself, to set timeouts and retry parameters, to get more detailed error status, etc. These additional interfaces should be provided in child packages of System.RPC. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>It is presumed that a body for the package System.RPC might be extremely environment specific. Therefore, we do not require that a body be provided by the (compiler) implementation.

</AnnotatedOnly>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<strong></strong>Experience has proved that the definition of System.RPC given here is inadequate for interfacing to existing distribution mechanisms (such as CORBA), especially on heterogeneous systems. Rather than mandate a change in the mechanism (which would break existing systems), require implementations to support multiple mechanisms (which is impractical), or prevent the use of Annex E facilities with existing systems (which would be silly), we simply make this facility optional.<br /></Admonition>

</MarginText>
</AnnotatedOnly>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
One of the purposes behind System.RPC was that knowledgeable users, rather than compiler vendors, could create this package tailored to their networks. Experience has shown that users get their RPC from vendors anyway; users have not taken advantage of the flexibility provided by this defined interface. Moreover, one could compare this defined interface to requiring Ada compilers to use a defined interface to implement tasking. No one thinks that the latter is a good idea, why should anyone believe that the former is?<br /></Admonition>

{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />Therefore, this subclause is made optional. We considered deleting the subclause outright, but we still require that users may replace the package (whatever its interface). Also, it still provides a useful guide to the implementation of this feature. <br /></Admonition>

NOTE 1   The package System.RPC is not designed for direct calls by user programs. It is instead designed for use in the implementation of remote subprograms calls, being called by the calling stubs generated for a remote call interface library unit to initiate a remote call, and in turn calling back to an RPC-receiver that dispatches to the receiving stubs generated for the body of a remote call interface, to handle a remote call received from elsewhere. <br /></Admonition>
