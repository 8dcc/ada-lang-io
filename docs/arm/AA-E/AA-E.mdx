<MarginText>1</MarginText>
<p>[This Annex defines facilities for supporting the implementation of distributed systems using multiple partitions working cooperatively as part of a single Ada program.] <br /></p>


#### Extensions to Ada 83

<MarginText>1.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
This Annex is new to Ada 95. <br /></Admonition>


#### Post-Compilation Rules

<MarginText>2</MarginText>
<p>A <em>distributed system</em> is an interconnection of one or more <em>processing nodes</em> (a system resource that has both computational and storage capabilities), and zero or more <em>storage nodes</em> (a system resource that has only storage capabilities, with the storage addressable by one or more processing nodes).<br /></p>

<MarginText>3</MarginText>
<p>A <em>distributed program</em> comprises one or more partitions that execute independently (except when they communicate) in a distributed system.<br /></p>

<MarginText>4</MarginText>
<p>The process of mapping the partitions of a program to the nodes in a distributed system is called <em>configuring the partitions of the program</em>. <br /></p>


#### Implementation Requirements

<MarginText>5</MarginText>
<p>The implementation shall provide means for explicitly assigning library units to a partition and for the configuring and execution of a program consisting of multiple partitions on a distributed system; the means are implementation defined. <br /></p>

<MarginText>5.a</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-defined" title="Implementation defined: ">
<strong></strong>The means for creating and executing distributed programs.<br /></Admonition>


#### Implementation Permissions

<MarginText>6</MarginText>
<p>An implementation may require that the set of processing nodes of a distributed system be homogeneous.<br /></p>

<MarginText>7/5</MarginText>
<MarginInfo items={["AI12-0440-1"]} /><Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
NOTE 1   {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0440-1"}</em>{"}"} <br />The partitions comprising a program can  be executed on differently configured distributed systems or on a nondistributed system without requiring recompilation. A distributed program can  be partitioned differently from the same set of library units without recompilation. The resulting execution is semantically equivalent.<br /></Admonition>

<MarginText>8</MarginText>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
NOTE 2   A distributed program retains the same type safety as the equivalent single partition program.<br /></Admonition>
