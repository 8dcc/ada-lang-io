# Annex E Distributed Systems

:::warning
We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.

<p>[This Annex defines facilities for supporting the implementation of distributed systems using multiple partitions working cooperatively as part of a single Ada program.] </p>

#### Extensions to Ada 83

<Admonition type="note">
<p>This Annex is new to Ada 95. </p></Admonition>


#### Post-Compilation Rules

<p>A <em>distributed system</em> is an interconnection of one or more <em>processing nodes</em> (a system resource that has both computational and storage capabilities), and zero or more <em>storage nodes</em> (a system resource that has only storage capabilities, with the storage addressable by one or more processing nodes).</p>
<p>A <em>distributed program</em> comprises one or more partitions that execute independently (except when they communicate) in a distributed system.</p>
<p>The process of mapping the partitions of a program to the nodes in a distributed system is called <em>configuring the partitions of the program</em>. </p>

#### Implementation Requirements

<p>The implementation shall provide means for explicitly assigning library units to a partition and for the configuring and execution of a program consisting of multiple partitions on a distributed system; the means are implementation defined. </p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p><strong>Implementation defined: </strong>The means for creating and executing distributed programs.</p></Admonition>


#### Implementation Permissions

<p>An implementation may require that the set of processing nodes of a distributed system be homogeneous.</p>
<Admonition type="note">
<p>NOTE 1   {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0440-1"}</em>{"}"} The partitions comprising a program can be executed on differently configured distributed systems or on a nondistributed system without requiring recompilation. A distributed program can be partitioned differently from the same set of library units without recompilation. The resulting execution is semantically equivalent.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
<p>NOTE 2   A distributed program retains the same type safety as the equivalent single partition program.</p></Admonition>
