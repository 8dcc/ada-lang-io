<p>A <em>generic unit</em> is a program unit that is either a generic subprogram or a generic package. A generic unit is a <em>template</em>[, which can be parameterized, and from which corresponding (nongeneric) subprograms or packages can be obtained]. The resulting program units are said to be <em>instances</em> of the original generic unit. <br /></p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="glossary-entry" title="Glossary entry: ">
<strong></strong>A generic unit is a template for a (nongeneric) program unit; the template can be parameterized by objects, types, subprograms, and packages. An instance of a generic unit is created by a <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0315">generic_instantiation</a></code>. The rules of the language are enforced when a generic unit is compiled, using a generic contract model; additional checks are performed upon instantiation to verify the contract is met. That is, the declaration of a generic unit represents a contract between the body of the generic and instances of the generic. Generic units can be used to perform the role that macros sometimes play in other languages.<br /></Admonition>

<p>[A generic unit is declared by a <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.1#S0310">generic_declaration</a></code>. This form of declaration has a <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.1#S0313">generic_formal_part</a></code> declaring any generic formal parameters. An instance of a generic unit is obtained as the result of a <code><a href="../AA-12/AA-12.3#S0315">generic_instantiation</a></code> with appropriate generic actual parameters for the generic formal parameters. An instance of a generic subprogram is a subprogram. An instance of a generic package is a package.<br /></p>

<p>Generic units are templates. As templates they do not have the properties that are specific to their nongeneric counterparts. For example, a generic subprogram can be instantiated but it cannot be called. In contrast, an instance of a generic subprogram is a (nongeneric) subprogram; hence, this instance can be called but it cannot be used to produce further instances.] <br /></p>
