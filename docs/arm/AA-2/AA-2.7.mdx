<p>A <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.7#S0018">comment</a></code> starts with two adjacent hyphens and extends up to the end of the line. </p>

#### Syntax

<p><code>comment</code><a id="S0018"></a><code> ::= </code>--{"{"}<em>non_end_of_line_</em><code>character</code>{"}"}</p>
<p>A <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.7#S0018">comment</a></code> may appear on any line of a program. </p>

#### Static Semantics

<p>The presence or absence of <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.7#S0018">comment</a></code>s has no influence on whether a program is legal or illegal. Furthermore, <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.7#S0018">comment</a></code>s do not influence the meaning of a program; their sole purpose is the enlightenment of the human reader. </p>

#### Examples

<p><em>Examples of comments:</em> </p>
<CodeBlock>
{"{"}{"AI12-0440-1"}{"}"} --  the last sentence above echoes the Algol 68 report {"\n"}{"\n"}end;  --  processing of Line is complete {"\n"}{"\n"}--  a long comment can be split onto{"\n"}--  two or more consecutive lines   {"\n"}{"\n"}----------------  the first two hyphens start the comment  {"\n"}
</CodeBlock>
