# Annex M Summary of Documentation Requirements

We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.
See the [tracking issue](https://github.com/ada-lang-io/ada-lang-io/issues/20)
:::
{AI05-0299-1} {AI12-0442-1} The Ada language allows for certain target machine dependences in a controlled manner. Each Ada implementation is required to document many characteristics and properties of the target system. This Reference Manual contains specific documentation requirements. In addition, many characteristics that require documentation are identified throughout this Reference Manual as being implementation defined. Finally, this Reference Manual requires documentation of whether implementation advice is followed. The following subclauses provide summaries of these documentation requirements.
