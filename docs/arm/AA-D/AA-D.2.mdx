<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} This introduction is simplified in order to reflect the rearrangement and expansion of this subclause. </p></Admonition>


## D.2.1  The Task Dispatching Model

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} [The task dispatching model specifies task scheduling, based on conceptual priority-ordered ready queues.] </p>

#### Static Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} The following language-defined library package exists: </p>
<CodeBlock>
{"{"}{"AI05-0166-1"}{"}"} {"{"}{"AI12-0241-1"}{"}"} {"{"}{"AI12-0302-1"}{"}"} package Ada.Dispatching{"\n"}  with Preelaborate, Nonblocking, Global ={">"} in out synchronized is{"\n"}

<CodeBlock>
{"{"}{"AI05-0166-1"}{"}"}   Dispatching_Policy_Error : exception;{"\n"}end Ada.Dispatching;{"\n"}
</CodeBlock>

<p>Dispatching serves as the parent of other language-defined library units concerned with task dispatching.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0279-1"}</em>{"}"} For a noninstance subprogram (including a generic formal subprogram), a generic subprogram, or an entry, the following language-defined aspect may be specified with an <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0346">aspect_specification</a></code> (see 13.1.1):</p>
<p>YieldThe type of aspect Yield is Boolean.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><strong>Aspect Description for </strong><strong>Yield: </strong>Ensures that a callable entity includes a task dispatching point.</p></Admonition>

<p>If directly specified, the <code><a href="../AA-13/AA-13.1#S0348">aspect_definition</a></code> shall be a static expression. If not specified (including by inheritance), the aspect is False.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0279-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0294-1"}</em>{"}"} If a Yield aspect is specified True for a primitive subprogram <em>S</em> of a type <em>T</em>, then the aspect is inherited by the corresponding primitive subprogram of each descendant of <em>T</em>. </p>

#### Legality Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0279-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0294-1"}</em>{"}"} If the Yield aspect is specified for a dispatching subprogram that inherits the aspect, the specified value shall be confirming.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0279-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0294-1"}</em>{"}"} If the Nonblocking aspect (see 9.5) of the associated callable entity is statically True, the Yield aspect shall not be specified as True. For a callable entity that is declared within a generic body, this rule is checked assuming that any nonstatic Nonblocking attributes in the expression of the Nonblocking aspect of the entity are statically True.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0294-1"}</em>{"}"} The second sentence here is an assume-the-worst rule. The only Nonblocking attributes that are nonstatic are those that depend, directly or indirectly, on the nonblocking aspect of a generic formal parameter. We have to assume these might in fact have the value True if given an appropriate actual entity. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0294-1"}</em>{"}"} In addition to the places where Legality Rules normally apply (see 12.3), these rules also apply in the private part of an instance of a generic unit. </p>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} A task can become a <em>running task</em> only if it is ready (see 9) and the execution resources required by that task are available. Processors are allocated to tasks based on each task's active priority.</p>
<p>It is implementation defined whether, on a multiprocessor, a task that is waiting for access to a protected object keeps its processor busy. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-defined" title="Implementation defined: ">
<p><strong></strong>Whether, on a multiprocessor, a task that is waiting for access to a protected object keeps its processor busy.</p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0119-1"}</em>{"}"} <em>Task dispatching</em> is the process by which a logical thread of control associated with a ready task is selected for execution on a processor. This selection is done during the execution of such a logical thread of control, at certain points called <em>task dispatching points</em>. Such a logical thread of control reaches a task dispatching point whenever it becomes blocked, and when its associated task terminates. [Other task dispatching points are defined throughout this Annex for specific policies.] Below we talk in terms of tasks, but in the context of a parallel construct, a single task can be represented by multiple logical threads of control, each of which can appear separately on a ready queue. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>On multiprocessor systems, more than one task can be chosen, at the same time, for execution on more than one processor, as explained below. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} <em>Task dispatching policies</em> are specified in terms of conceptual <em>ready queues</em> and task states. A ready queue is an ordered list of ready tasks. The first position in a queue is called the <em>head of the queue</em>, and the last position is called the <em>tail of the queue</em>. A task is <em>ready</em> if it is in a ready queue, or if it is running. Each processor has one ready queue for each priority value. At any instant, each ready queue of a processor contains exactly the set of tasks of that priority that are ready for execution on that processor, but are not running on any processor; that is, those tasks that are ready, are not running on any processor, and can be executed using that processor and other available resources. A task can be on the ready queues of more than one processor. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>The core language defines a ready task as one that is not blocked. Here we refine this definition and talk about ready queues. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} Each processor also has one <em>running task</em>, which is the task currently being executed by that processor. Whenever a task running on a processor reaches a task dispatching point it goes back to one or more ready queues; a task (possibly the same task) is then selected to run on that processor. The task selected is the one at the head of the highest priority nonempty ready queue; this task is then removed from all ready queues to which it belongs. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>There is always at least one task to run, if we count the idle task. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0166-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0241-1"}</em>{"}"} A call of Yield and a <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.6#S0266">delay_statement</a></code> are task dispatching points for all language-defined policies.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><em>This paragraph was deleted.</em></p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0279-1"}</em>{"}"} If the Yield aspect has the value True, then a call to procedure Yield is included within the body of the associated callable entity, and invoked immediately prior to returning from the body if and only if no other task dispatching points were encountered during the execution of the body. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p><em>This paragraph was deleted.</em></p></Admonition>


#### Implementation Permissions

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} An implementation is allowed to define additional resources as execution resources, and to define the corresponding allocation policies for them. Such resources may have an implementation-defined effect on task dispatching. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="implementation-defined" title="Implementation defined: ">
<p><strong></strong>The effect of implementation-defined execution resources on task dispatching.</p></Admonition>

<p>An implementation may place implementation-defined restrictions on tasks whose active priority is in the Interrupt_Priority range. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} For example, on some operating systems, it might be necessary to disallow them altogether. This permission applies to tasks whose priority is set to interrupt level for any reason: via an aspect, via a call to Dynamic_Priorities.Set_Priority, or via priority inheritance. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} Unless otherwise specified for a task dispatching policy, an implementation may add additional points at which task dispatching may occur, in an implementation-defined manner.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} This permission is intended to allow the implementation of Ada tasks in terms of target system threads, which may have additional conditions that cause task dispatching. For instance, for Linux threads, page faults are task dispatching points. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} The Non_Preemptive_FIFO_Within_Priorities task dispatching policy (see D.2.4) does not allow additional task dispatching points. </p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 1   {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} Clause 9 specifies under which circumstances a task becomes ready. The ready state is affected by the rules for task activation and termination, delay statements, and entry calls. When a task is not ready, it is said to be blocked.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 2   {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0442-1"}</em>{"}"} An example of a possible implementation-defined execution resource is a page of physical memory, which must be loaded with a particular page of virtual memory before a task can continue execution.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 3   The ready queues are purely conceptual; there is no requirement that such lists physically exist in an implementation.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 4   While a task is running, it is not on any ready queue. Any time the task that is running on a processor is added to a ready queue, a new running task is selected for that processor.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 5   In a multiprocessor system, a task can be on the ready queues of more than one processor. At the extreme, if several processors share the same set of ready tasks, the contents of their ready queues is identical, and so they can be viewed as sharing one ready queue, and can be implemented that way. [Thus, the dispatching model covers multiprocessors where dispatching is implemented using a single ready queue, as well as those with separate dispatching domains.]</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 6   The priority of a task is determined by rules specified in this subclause, and under D.1, "Task Priorities", D.3, "Priority Ceiling Locking", and D.5, "Dynamic Priorities".</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>NOTE 7   {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} The setting of a task's base priority as a result of a call to Set_Priority does not always take effect immediately when Set_Priority is called. The effect of setting the task's base priority is deferred while the affected task performs a protected action.</p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00321-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} This description is simplified to describe only the parts of the dispatching model common to all policies. In particular, rules about preemption are moved elsewhere. This makes it easier to add other policies (which might not involve preemption). </p></Admonition>


#### Incompatibilities With Ada 2005

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0166-1"}</em>{"}"} Procedure Yield is added to Dispatching. If Dispatching is referenced in a <code><a href="../AA-8/AA-8.4#S0235">use_clause</a></code>, and an entity <em>E</em> with a <code><a href="../AA-3/AA-3.1#S0022">defining_identifier</a></code> of Yield is defined in a package that is also referenced in a <code><a href="../AA-8/AA-8.4#S0235">use_clause</a></code>, the entity <em>E</em> may no longer be use-visible, resulting in errors. This should be rare and is easily fixed if it does occur.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0166-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} Package Dispatching was a Pure package, but now is Preelaborated with the addition of Yield. This is incompatible as Dispatching can no longer be depended upon from a Pure package. This should happen rarely in practice as the only contents was the exception Dispatching_Policy_Error and none of the child packages that could raise that exception are pure. </p></Admonition>


#### Inconsistencies With Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong></strong> Substantially reduced the Implementation Permission that used to allow "altering" task dispatching points to only allow adding task dispatching points. If an implementation was using this permission to remove task dispatching points, and a program depended on that behavior to work, it could fail when used with Ada 2022. We are not aware of any such implementations, and such behavior was never portable to other implementations, so we do not expect this to matter in practice. </p></Admonition>


#### Extensions to Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0279-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0294-1"}</em>{"}"} Aspect Yield is new. </p></Admonition>


#### Wording Changes from Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0119-1"}</em>{"}"} Redid the description of task dispatching to include the separate threads of control that can be started by a parallel construct. </p></Admonition>


## D.2.2  Task Dispatching Pragmas

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} [This subclause allows a single task dispatching policy to be defined for all priorities, or the range of priorities to be split into subranges that are assigned individual dispatching policies.] </p>

#### Syntax

<p>The form of a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> Task_Dispatching_Policy is as follows: </p>
<p>  <strong>pragma</strong> Task_Dispatching_Policy(<em>policy_</em><code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code>);</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} The form of a <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> Priority_Specific_Dispatching is as follows: </p>
<p>  <strong>pragma</strong> Priority_Specific_Dispatching (     <em>policy_</em><code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code>, <em>first_priority_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code>, <em>last_priority_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code>);</p>

#### Name Resolution Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} The expected type for <em>first_priority_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> and <em>last_priority_</em><code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> is Integer. </p>

Tasks with base priorities within the range of priorities specified in a Priority_Specific_Dispatching pragma have their active priorities determined according to the specified dispatching policy. Tasks with active priorities within the range of priorities specified in a Priority_Specific_Dispatching pragma are dispatched according to the specified dispatching policy. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} Each ready queue is managed by exactly one policy. Anything else would be chaos. The ready queue is determined by the active priority. However, how the active priority is calculated is determined by the policy; in order to break out of this circle, we have to say that the active priority is calculated by the method determined by the policy of the base priority. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0262-1"}</em>{"}"} If a partition contains one or more Priority_Specific_Dispatching pragmas, the dispatching policy for priorities not covered by any Priority_Specific_Dispatching pragmas is FIFO_Within_Priorities.</p>

#### Post-Compilation Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} A Task_Dispatching_Policy pragma is a configuration pragma. A Priority_Specific_Dispatching pragma is a configuration pragma. </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} The priority ranges specified in more than one Priority_Specific_Dispatching pragma within the same partition shall not be overlapping.</p>

<p><em>This paragraph was deleted.</em>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00333-01"}</em>{"}"} </p>

#### Dynamic Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} [A <em>task dispatching policy</em> specifies the details of task dispatching that are not covered by the basic task dispatching model. These rules govern when tasks are inserted into and deleted from the ready queues.] A single task dispatching policy is specified by a Task_Dispatching_Policy pragma. Pragma Priority_Specific_Dispatching assigns distinct dispatching policies to subranges of System.Any_Priority.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} If neither <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> applies to any of the program units comprising a partition, the task dispatching policy for that partition is unspecified.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0262-1"}</em>{"}"} If a partition contains one or more Priority_Specific_Dispatching pragmas, a task dispatching point occurs for the currently running task of a processor whenever there is a nonempty ready queue for that processor with a higher priority than the priority of the running task.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="discussion" title="Discussion: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0005-1"}</em>{"}"} If we have priority specific dispatching then we want preemption across the entire range of priorities. That prevents higher priority tasks from being blocked by lower priority tasks that have a different policy. On the other hand, if we have a single policy for the entire partition, we want the characteristics of that policy to apply for preemption; specifically, we might not require any preemption. Note that policy Non_Preemptive_FIFO_Within_Priorities is not allowed in a priority specific dispatching pragma. </p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} A task that has its base priority changed may move from one dispatching policy to another. It is immediately subject to the new dispatching policy.</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>Once subject to the new dispatching policy, it may be immediately preempted or dispatched, according the rules of the new policy. </p></Admonition>

#### Implementation Requirements

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00333-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} An implementation shall allow, for a single partition, both the locking policy (see D.3) to be specified as Ceiling_Locking and also one or more Priority_Specific_Dispatching pragmas to be given. </p>

#### Wording Changes from Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00256-01"}</em>{"}"} Clarified that an implementation need support only one task dispatching policy (of any kind, language-defined or otherwise) per partition.</p></Admonition>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0166-1"}</em>{"}"} The following language-defined library package exists: </p>
<CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>For language-defined policies other than Non_Preemptive_FIFO_Within_Priorities, a higher priority task should never be on a ready queue while a lower priority task is executed. Thus, for such policies, Yield_To_Higher does nothing.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>Yield_To_Higher is <em>not</em> a potentially blocking operation; it can be used during a protected operation. That is allowed, as under the predefined Ceiling_Locking policy any task with a higher priority than the protected operation cannot call the operation (that would violate the locking policy). An implementation-defined locking policy may need to define the semantics of Yield_To_Higher differently. </p></Admonition>


#### Legality Rules

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00355-01"}</em>{"}"} Non_Preemptive_FIFO_Within_Priorities shall not be specified as the <em>policy_</em><code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.3#S0002">identifier</a></code> of <code><a href="../AA-2/AA-2.8#S0019">pragma</a></code> Priority_Specific_Dispatching (see D.2.2).</p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">

That would render the use of such policies impotent and misleading. As such, this policy only makes sense for a complete system. </p></Admonition>


#### Dynamic Semantics

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00298-01"}</em>{"}"} When Non_Preemptive_FIFO_Within_Priorities is in effect, modifications to the ready queues occur only as follows:</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00298-01"}</em>{"}"} When a blocked task becomes ready, it is added at the tail of the ready queue for its active priority.</p>
<p>When the active priority of a ready task that is not running changes, or the setting of its base priority takes effect, the task is removed from the ready queue for its old active priority and is added at the tail of the ready queue for its new active priority.</p>
<p>When the setting of the base priority of a running task takes effect, the task is added to the tail of the ready queue for its active priority.</p>
<p>When a task executes a <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.6#S0266">delay_statement</a></code> that does not result in blocking, it is added to the tail of the ready queue for its active priority. </p>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0166-1"}</em>{"}"} A <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.6#S0266">delay_statement</a></code> is always a task dispatching point even if it is not blocking. Similarly, a call to Yield_To_Higher is never blocking, but it is a task dispatching point In each of these cases, they can cause the current task to stop running (it is still ready). Otherwise, the running task continues to run until it is blocked.</p></Admonition>

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} This rule supersedes the Implementation Permission of D.2.1; an implementation that adds additional task dispatching points to this policy is incorrect. </p></Admonition>


#### Implementation Requirements

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00333-01"}</em>{"}"} An implementation shall allow, for a single partition, both the task dispatching policy to be specified as Non_Preemptive_FIFO_Within_Priorities and also the locking policy (see D.3) to be specified as Ceiling_Locking. </p>

#### Implementation Permissions

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00298-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0269-1"}</em>{"}"} Since implementations are allowed to round all ceiling priorities in subrange System.Priority to System.Priority'Last (see D.3), an implementation may allow a task of a partition using the Non_Premptive_FIFO_Within_Priorities policy to execute within a protected object without raising its active priority provided the associated protected unit does not contain any subprograms with aspects Interrupt_Handler or Attach_Handler specified, nor does the unit have aspect Interrupt_Priority  specified. When the locking policy (see D.3) is Ceiling_Locking, an implementation taking advantage of this permission shall ensure that a call to Yield_to_Higher that occurs within a protected action uses the ceiling priority of the protected object (rather than the active priority of the task) when determining whether to preempt the task. </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="reason" title="Reason: ">
<p><strong></strong>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0269-1"}</em>{"}"} We explicitly require that the ceiling priority be used in calls to Yield_to_Higher in order to prevent a risk of priority inversion and consequent loss of mutual exclusion when Yield_to_Higher is used in a protected object. This requirement might lessen the value of the permission (as the current Ceiling_Priority will have to be maintained in the TCB), but loss of mutual exclusion cannot be tolerated. The primary benefit of the permission (eliminating the need for preemption at the end of a protected action) is still available. As noted above, an implementation-defined locking policy will need to specify the semantics of Yield_to_Higher, including this case. </p></Admonition>

<p>When a task is added or moved to the tail of the ready queue for its base priority, it has an execution time budget equal to the quantum for that priority level. This will also occur when a blocked task becomes executable again.</p>
<p>When a task is preempted (by a higher priority task) and is added to the head of the ready queue for its priority level, it retains its remaining budget.</p>
<p>While a task is executing, its budget is decreased by the amount of execution time it uses. The accuracy of this accounting is the same as that for execution time clocks (see D.14). </p>
<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="ramification" title="Ramification: ">

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI05-0229-1"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} The initial absolute deadline for a task with a specified Relative_Deadline is the result of adding the value returned by a call of Real_Time.Clock to the value of the <code><a href="../AA-4/AA-4.4#S0132">expression</a></code> specified as the Relative_Deadline aspect, where this entire computation, including the call of Real_Time.Clock, is performed between task creation and the start of its activation. If the aspect Relative_Deadline is not specified, then the initial absolute deadline of a task is the value of Default_Deadline (Ada.Real_Time.Time_Last).

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} The effect of specifying a Relative_Deadline aspect for a protected type or <code><a href="../AA-9/AA-9.4#S0250">single_protected_declaration</a></code> is discussed in D.3.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} A task has both an <em>active</em> and a <em>base</em> absolute deadline. These are the same except when the task is inheriting a relative deadline during activation or a rendezvous (see below) or within a protected action (see D.3). The procedure Set_Deadline changes the (base) absolute deadline of the task to D. The function Get_Deadline returns the (base) absolute deadline of the task.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} The procedure Set_Relative_Deadline changes the relative deadline of the task to D. The function Get_Relative_Deadline returns the relative deadline of the task.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} The function Get_Last_Release_Time returns the time, as provided by Real_Time.Clock, when the task was last made ready (that is, was added to a ready queue).</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} The procedure Delay_Until_And_Set_Deadline delays the calling task until time Delay_Until_Time. When the task becomes ready again it will have deadline Delay_Until_Time + Deadline_Offset.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} On a system with a single processor, the setting of the deadline of a task to the new value occurs immediately at the first point that is outside the execution of a protected action. If the task is currently on a ready queue it is removed and re-entered onto the ready queue determined by the rules defined below.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} When EDF_Within_Priorities is specified for a priority, the ready queue for that priority is ordered by deadline. The task at the head of a queue is the one with the earliest deadline.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} A task dispatching point occurs for the currently running task <em>T</em> to which policy EDF_Within_Priorities applies:</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} when a change to the base (absolute) deadline of <em>T</em> occurs;</p>
<p><em>This paragraph was deleted.</em>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} </p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} there is a nonempty ready queue for that processor with a higher priority than the active priority of the running task;</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} there is a ready task with the same priority as <em>T</em> but with an earlier absolute deadline.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} In these cases, the currently running task is said to be preempted and is returned to the ready queue for its active priority, at a position determined by its active (absolute) deadline.</p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} {"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} When the setting of the base priority of a ready task takes effect and the new priority is specified as EDF_Within_Priorities, the task is added to the ready queue, at a position determined by its active deadline.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} For all the operations defined in Dispatching.EDF, Tasking_Error is raised if the task identified by T has terminated. Program_Error is raised if the value of T is Null_Task_Id.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} If two tasks with priority designated as EDF_Within_Priorities rendezvous then the deadline for the execution of the accept statement is the earlier of the deadlines of the two tasks.</p>
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} During activation, a task being activated inherits the deadline that its activator (see 9.2) had at the time the activation was initiated.</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 30 was deleted.</em> </p>

#### Erroneous Execution

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} If a value of Task_Id is passed as a parameter to any of the subprograms of this package and the corresponding task object no longer exists, the execution of the program is erroneous.</p>

#### Documentation Requirements

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI95-00357-01"}</em>{"}"} On a multiprocessor, the implementation shall document any conditions that cause the completion of the setting of the deadline of a task to be delayed later than what is specified for a single processor. </p>

#### Extensions to Ada 95

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">

#### Wording Changes from Ada 2005

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="correction" title="Correction:">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0055-1"}</em>{"}"} <strong></strong> Corrected definition of active priority to avoid deadline inversion in an unusual case. </p></Admonition>


#### Incompatibilities With Ada 2012

<Admonition type="aarm" aarm="note" title="Note: ">
<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI12-0230-1"}</em>{"}"} The policy EDF_Across_Priorities was replaced by EDF_Within_Priorities. A program using EDF_Across_Priorities could fail to compile. However, we not are aware of any implementations of EDF_Across_Priorities, so it seems unlikely that any such programs exist outside of books and papers. </p></Admonition>
