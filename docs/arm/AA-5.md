We're still working on the Reference manual output.  Internal links are broken,
as are a bunch of other things.
See the [tracking issue](https://github.com/ada-lang-io/ada-lang-io/issues/20)
:::
[A [statement](./AA-5.1#S0167) defines an action to be performed upon its execution.]

{AI95-00318-02} {AI05-0299-1} [This clause describes the general rules applicable to all [statement](./AA-5.1#S0167)s. Some [statement](./AA-5.1#S0167)s are discussed in later clauses: [Procedure_call_statement](./AA-6.4#S0217)s and return statements are described in 6, "Subprograms". [Entry_call_statement](./AA-9.5#S0264)s, [requeue_statement](./AA-9.5#S0265)s, [delay_statement](./AA-9.6#S0266)s, [accept_statement](./AA-9.5#S0258)s, [select_statement](./AA-9.7#S0269)s, and [abort_statement](./AA-9.8#S0284)s are described in 9, "Tasks and Synchronization". [Raise_statement](./AA-11.3#S0308)s are described in 11, "Exceptions", and [code_statement](./AA-13.8#S0357)s in 13. The remaining forms of [statement](./AA-5.1#S0167)s are presented in this clause.] 


#### Wording Changes from Ada 83

{AI95-00318-02} The description of return statements has been moved to 6.5, "Return Statements", so that it is closer to the description of subprograms.
