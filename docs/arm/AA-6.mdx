<p>A subprogram is a program unit or intrinsic operation whose execution is invoked by a subprogram call. There are two forms of subprogram: procedures and functions. A procedure call is a <code><a href="./AA-5.1#S0167">statement</a></code>; a function call is an expression and returns a value. The definition of a subprogram can be given in two parts: a subprogram declaration defining its interface, and a <code><a href="./AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code> defining its execution. [Operators and enumeration literals are functions.] </p>
<p><strong>To be honest: </strong>A function call is an expression, but more specifically it is a <code><a href="./AA-4.1#S0091">name</a></code>. </p>
<p><strong>Glossary entry: </strong>A subprogram is a section of a program that can be executed in various contexts. It is invoked by a subprogram call that may qualify the effect of the subprogram through the passing of parameters. There are two forms of subprograms: functions, which return values, and procedures, which do not.</p>
<p><strong>Glossary entry: </strong>A function is a form of subprogram that returns a result and can be called as part of an expression.</p>
<p><strong>Glossary entry: </strong>A procedure is a form of subprogram that does not return a result and can only be called by a <code><a href="./AA-5.1#S0167">statement</a></code>.</p>

<p>{"{"}<em>{"AI05-0299-1"}</em>{"}"} A <em>callable entity</em> is a subprogram or entry (see Section 9). A callable entity is invoked by a <em>call</em>; that is, a subprogram call or entry call. A <em>callable construct</em> is a construct that defines the action of a call upon a callable entity: a <code><a href="./AA-6.3#S0216">subprogram_body</a></code>, <code><a href="./AA-9.5#S0260">entry_body</a></code>, or <code><a href="./AA-9.5#S0258">accept_statement</a></code>. </p>
<p><strong>Ramification: </strong>Note that "callable entity" includes predefined operators, enumeration literals, and abstract subprograms. "Call" includes calls of these things. They do not have callable constructs, since they don't have completions. </p>
