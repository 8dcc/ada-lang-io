There's a lot of sites online about Ada, many of which are sadly not being
updated anymore. An open source site, with multiple people with access
permissions will be more likely to be maintained in the future.

I'd thought about there needing to be a more centralized community site for a
while, but it was [Maxim's reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ada/comments/wx9zp1/yet_another_ada_web_site/)
that really motivated me to make this for everyone.

This is a new website to be handed off to the Ada open source community
as their own resource to build upon. I've created a
[GitHub organization and a repository for this](https://github.com/ada-lang-io/ada-lang-io),
and added those who expressed interest as collaborators.
[My old site has been archived](https://github.com/pyjarrett/programming-with-ada),
with the content slowly being moved over to here. As for "Who will own this
domain in the future?", my response would be that I would expect to transfer
it to one of the existing Ada organizations.

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) was picked for this site since it allows both
Markdown as well as React content. The ubiquity of markdown means that almost anyone
can write and submit content, but the React side means there's capability for those
who want to add more sophisticated content. Docusaurus's rich set of capabilities
also includes important elements such as different page languages, for the
multilingual and worldwide distributed Ada community.

It's important that this site be a source of positivity, and that the focus be
on Daniele Procida's [four kinds of technical documentation](https://www.writethedocs.oorg/videos/eu/2017/the-four-kinds-of-documentation-and-why-you-need-to-understand-what-they-are-daniele-procida/).

1. Learning-oriented tutorials
2. Goal-oriented how-to guides
3. Understanding-oriented discussions
4. Information-oriented reference material

In my own journey learning Ada, these matched up relatively in this way:

1. learn.adacore.com, John Barne's "Ada 2012" book
2. Rosetta code, Ada wikibook, reading source code of other projects
3. Ada 2012 Rationale
4. Ada Annotated Reference Manual

Ada is not that difficult of a language to learn, though the spread out nature
of its resources makes it more challenging.

My hope is that this place fulfill's Maxim's vision:

> an "eternal" site driven by the community, that will outlive its creators.
>
> - Where novice adepts could find out how to start using or learn.
> - Where old users could share their knowledge, promote thier projects.

cheers,
