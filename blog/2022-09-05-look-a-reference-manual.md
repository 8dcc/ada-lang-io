There's now a very rough version of the [Reference Manual here.][ref-manual]

<!--truncate-->

Steady progress is being made. Many thanks to Onox for the help. I'm not a
web developer, that problem space is vast, and Onox keeps making great strides
across the board, making sure things are being done modernly, while also
cleaning up my metaphoric crayon scribbles of React into something much more
refined.

An application has been made to [Algolia Search,][algolia-search]
for indexing and site search. As the Reference Manual becomes more finished,
it will be fantastic to have a fast search built on top.

Tutorial writing continues. These being develop focus on introducing as few
concepts and little jargon at a time, targeting new programmers. This makes
each tutorial difficult to write, and reminds me
[Guy Steele's OOPSLA Talk, "Growing a Language"][growing-a-language], though
the results seem worth it.

The language comparison from the old "Programming with Ada" site has been
condensed and turned into a [syntax cheat sheet][cheat-sheet] for easy
reference.  It still needs some formatting help and some sections are
missing (like concurrency), but the perfect is the enemy of the good.

Thanks to everyone who has been contributing with code or ideas,
this is already better than I ever thought it would be, and we're still
improving.

cheers,

PJ
